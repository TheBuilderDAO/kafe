# Manage admin KafÃ© list

The following guide shows you how to add and remove reviewer on KafÃ©.

ðŸš¨ Please confirm with @Daniel Gamboa before adding or removing reviewer.

## Prerequisites

- You must have setup the builderdao CLI.
- You must be an admin on KafÃ©.
- You must use your Solana account registered as an admin.

## Instructions

1. Intuitively, we can use two commands to manage reviewer, `addReviewer` and `removeReviewer`. To know more, we can use the `builderdao admin addReviewer -h` command to see what options we need to pass:

```text
Usage: builderdao admin addReviewer [options]

Add a reviewer to Kafe program

Options:
  --adminKp <adminKp>        Admin KeyPair (bs58 encoded) (env: ADMIN_KP)
  --reviewerPk <reviewerPk>  address of the new reviewer
  --ghHandle <ghHandle>      github handle of the new reviewer
  -h, --help                 display help for command

Add an reviewer Solana pubkey to the Kafe program

Example call:
$ builderdao admin addReviewer --adminKp <bs58Secret> --reviewerPk <bs58Pubkey> --ghHandle <string>
```

2. Here we see that we need to pass a public address for the account we want to add or remove from the reviewer list using the option `--address`. Moreover, we need to pass a private key using the `--adminKp` option to authenticate ourselves as an admin. Last but not least the `ghHandle` is the github handle of the reviewer

3. With your private key in your clipboard, go back to your terminal and issue the following command:

```text
builderdao admin addReviewer --adminKp <paste-your-private-key-here> \
--address <paste-destination-public-address-here> \
--ghHandle <string>
```

```text
âœ” signature: <some-signature-hash-if-the-transaction-was-successful>
```

4. Once the reviewer added on Solana program, it's mandatory for the writing process to ensure that the reviewer as been added as a collaborator to the github repository.
