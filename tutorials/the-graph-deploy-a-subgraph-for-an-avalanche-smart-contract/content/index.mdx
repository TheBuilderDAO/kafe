## Introduction

In this tutorial you will learn how to deploy a Solidity smart contract to the Avalanche Fuji testnet using HardHat, then create and deploy its subgraph to the Subgraph Studio.

![Subgraph Studio](./assets/the-graph-deploy-a-subgraph-for-an-avalanche-smart-contract-subgraph-studio-1.png)

The Subgraph Studio is where you can build and create subgraphs. You can add metadata to your graphs (even after deploying your subgraphs), deploy multiple versions of your subgraphs, as well as publish them to the decentralized Graph Explorer. Do note that publishing a subgraph is different from deploying a subgraph. When you deploy a subgraph, you alone can access it. But when you publish it, it's created on-chain, and everyone can access it.

You can also test your subgraphs in the Playground, where you can run graphql queries without incurring any querying fees. In this tutorial, you shall also learn how to create and deploy your subgraph to Subgraph Studio using an Avalanche smart contract.

When you know the address of a smart contract, assuming that the contract is verified on etherscan, you can easily build a subgraph schema for it. If not, you can provide the local path of the Application Binary Interface (ABI) to the Graph CLI in order to create a subgraph schema. By default, HardHat does not export the ABI after compilation of the smart contract. However it is possible to use a HardHat plugin to automatically export the ABI when a smart contract is compiled.

## Prerequisites

To successfully complete this tutorial, you will need to have a basic understanding of Avalanche, Solidity, and the NodeJS ecosystem.

## Requirements

- You will need Metamask installed in your browser. You can install it from <https://metamask.io/>
- You need to have a recent version of Node.js installed. We recommend using v14.17.6 LTS for compatibility.

## Project setup

Run the following command to install the yarn package manager and the Graph Protocol CLI globally. These are required to build and deploy your subgraph.

```text
npm i -g yarn @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

Then run the following commands to create a new directory called `vending`, and then change into the directory:

```text
mkdir vending
cd vending
```

Then run the below commands to create a new yarn package inside it, and then install Hardhat as a dev-dependency of the project (meaning that it is a package that is only needed for local development and testing).

```text
yarn init --yes
yarn add --dev hardhat
```

Then run `npx hardhat` to initialize the Hardhat project. This will output:

```text
888    888                      888 888               888
888    888                      888 888               888
888    888                      888 888               888
8888888888  8888b.  888d888 .d88888 88888b.   8888b.  888888
888    888     "88b 888P"  d88" 888 888 "88b     "88b 888
888    888 .d888888 888    888  888 888  888 .d888888 888
888    888 888  888 888    Y88b 888 888  888 888  888 Y88b.
888    888 "Y888888 888     "Y88888 888  888 "Y888888  "Y888

Welcome to Hardhat v2.6.4

? What do you want to do? …
▸ Create a basic sample project
  Create an advanced sample project
  Create an empty hardhat.config.js
  Quit
```

Select "Create an empty hardhat.config.js" by scrolling down the menu with the arrow keys on your keyboard and press Enter. This will create a `hardhat.config.js` file in the root of the `vending` directory, with the following contents:

```javascript
/**
 * @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig
 */
module.exports = {
  solidity: '0.7.3',
};
```

Since Avalanche network is compatible with Ethereum's Virtual Machine (EVM), you can use any available HardHat plugins to compile and deploy your contract:

```text
yarn add --dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle
```

## Writing the smart contract

Create a new directory called `contracts` inside the `vending` directory, then create a file inside the `contracts` directory called `vending.sol`.

Paste this Solidity code into that file:

```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity 0.7.3;

contract VendingMachine {

    // Store the owner of this smart contract
    address owner;

    // A mapping is a key/value store. Here we store cupcake balance of this smart contract.
    mapping (address => uint) cupcakeBalances;

    // Events are necessary for The Graph to create entities
    event Refill(address owner, uint amount, uint remaining, uint timestamp, uint blockNumber);
    event Purchase(address buyer, uint amount, uint remaining, uint timestamp, uint blockNumber);

    // When 'VendingMachine' contract is deployed:
    // 1. set the deploying address as the owner of the contract
    // 2. set the deployed smart contract's cupcake balance to 100
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        cupcakeBalances[address(this)] = 100;
    }

    // Allow the owner to increase the smart contract's cupcake balance
    function refill(uint amount) public onlyOwner {
        cupcakeBalances[address(this)] += amount;
        emit Refill(owner, amount, cupcakeBalances[address(this)], block.timestamp, block.number);
    }

    // Allow anyone to purchase cupcakes
    function purchase(uint amount) public payable {
        require(msg.value >= amount * 0.01 ether, "You must pay at least 0.01 ETH per cupcake");
        require(cupcakeBalances[address(this)] >= amount, "Not enough cupcakes in stock to complete this purchase");
        cupcakeBalances[address(this)] -= amount;
        cupcakeBalances[msg.sender] += amount;
        emit Purchase(msg.sender, amount, cupcakeBalances[address(this)], block.timestamp, block.number);
    }

    // Function modifiers are used to modify the behaviour of a function.
    // When "onlyOwner" modifier is added to a function, only the owner of this smart contract can execute that function.
    modifier onlyOwner {
        // Verifying that the owner is same as the one who called the function.
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner callable");

        // This underscore character is called the "merge wildcard".
        // It will be replaced with the body of the function (to which we added the modifier),
        _;
    }
}
```

## Compiling the smart contract

We will install the `hardhat-abi-exporter` plugin so that HardHat will export the smart contract ABI after compilation:

```text
yarn add --dev hardhat-abi-exporter
```

Update your `hardhat.config.js` file to use the abi exporter:

```javascript
require('@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle');
require('hardhat-abi-exporter');

module.exports = {
  solidity: '0.7.3',
  abiExporter: {
    path: './abi/',
    clear: true,
  },
};
```

- **path**: The path to your ABI export directory (relative to the HardHat project's root). The directory will be created if it does not exist.
- **clear**: A boolean value that determines whether to delete old files from the specified path on compilation.

HardHat will use the specified version of solc (v0.7.3) to compile your smart contract. Run:

```text
npx hardhat compile
```

Assuming there are no errors or warnings, this will output:

```text
Compiling 1 file with 0.7.3
Compilation finished successfully
```

The `vending.sol` smart contract has now been compiled successfully. The ABI will be stored in `abi/contracts/vending.sol/VendingMachine.json`.

## Deploying the smart contract

Though this step is not necessary for creating your subgraph, you can still deploy your smart contract to learn about the Avalanche network and DataHub.

Add the constants `FUJI_PRIVATE_KEY` and `DATAHUB_API_KEY` as well as a **networks** entry in your `hardhat.config.js` file:

```javascript
require('@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle');
require('hardhat-abi-exporter');

// Replace this private key with your Fuji wallet private key
const FUJI_PRIVATE_KEY = 'YOUR_FUJI_PRIVATE_KEY';

// Replace this with your Datahub api key
const DATAHUB_API_KEY = 'YOUR_DATAHUB_API_KEY';

module.exports = {
  solidity: '0.7.3',
  abiExporter: {
    path: './abi/',
    clear: true,
  },
  networks: {
    fuji: {
      url: `https://avalanche--fuji--rpc.datahub.figment.io/apikey/${DATAHUB_API_KEY}/ext/bc/C/rpc`,
      accounts: [`0x${FUJI_PRIVATE_KEY}`],
    },
  },
};
```

### Getting your Datahub API Key

To get your `DATAHUB_API_KEY`, head over to <https://datahub.figment.io/sign_up> and create a free account.

![Datahub Signup](./assets/the-graph-deploy-a-subgraph-for-an-avalanche-smart-contract-datahub-signup-2.png)

Click on the verification link you shall receive in your email. After email verification, you will be redirected to <https://datahub.figment.io/>.

![Datahub Avalanche](./assets/the-graph-deploy-a-subgraph-for-an-avalanche-smart-contract-datahub-avalanche-3.png)

Click on the `Avalanche` button to view the Avalanche Services Dashboard at <https://datahub.figment.io/services/avalanche>. You can copy your API key to the clipboard by clicking on the **copy** button.

![Datahub Avalanche API Key](./assets/the-graph-deploy-a-subgraph-for-an-avalanche-smart-contract-datahub-avalanche-api-key-4.png)

### Getting your Metamask private key

You need to add a connection to the Avalanche Fuji testnet to your Metamask by following the instructions below (remember to replace `<YOUR DATAHUB_API_KEY>` in the RPC URL with your actual DataHub API key):

- Login in to Metamask
- Click on the `Network` drop-down
- Select `Custom RPC`
- Fill in the details:
  - **Network Name**: Avalanche FUJI C-Chain
  - **New RPC URL**: `https://avalanche--fuji--rpc.datahub.figment.io/apikey/<YOUR DATAHUB_API_KEY>/ext/bc/C/rpc`
  - **ChainID**: `43113`
  - **Symbol**: `AVAX`
  - **Explorer**: `https://cchain.explorer.avax-test.network`

![Metamask FUJI Avalanche](./assets/the-graph-deploy-a-subgraph-for-an-avalanche-smart-contract-metamask-fuji-avalanche-5.png)

You will also need some Fuji AVAX tokens in your Metamask wallet. Follow the instructions below:

- Go to <https://faucet.avax-test.network/>, and paste your Metamask wallet address.
- Complete the captcha, and click on the Request button
- You shall receive 10 Fuji AVAX once your transaction is mined

To get your `FUJI_PRIVATE_KEY`, open your browser and open Metamask. Select **Avalanche FUJI C-Chain** network. Click on Account details, and click on `Export Private Key`.

**Never ever share your private key with anyone!**

Create a subdirectory inside the HardHat project called `scripts`, and paste the following code into a new file `deploy.js` inside the `scripts` directory:

```javascript
async function main() {
  const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();

  console.log('Deploying contracts with the account:', deployer.address);
  console.log('Account balance:', (await deployer.getBalance()).toString());

  const VendingMachine = await ethers.getContractFactory('VendingMachine');
  const vendingMachine = await VendingMachine.deploy();

  console.log('Contract address:', vendingMachine.address);
}

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

To deploy the smart contract to the Fuji testnet using HardHat, run the command:

```text
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network fuji
```

This will output:

```text
Deploying contracts with the account: <YOUR FUJI WALLET ADDRESS>
Account balance: <YOUR FUJI WALLET BALANCE>
Contract address: <YOUR FUJI SMART CONTRACT ADDRESS>
```

Congratulations! You just deployed your smart contract successfully to Fuji testnet! We will need the contract address when creating the subgraph, so remember to copy it.

## Creating the subgraph

Run the following command to create the subgraph by downloading the contract ABI from the Fuji testnet. A new directory called `vending` will be created, and all node dependencies will be installed automatically.

```text
graph init \
  --contract-name VendingMachine \
  --index-events \
  --studio \
  --from-contract <YOUR FUJI SMART CONTRACT ADDRESS> \
  --abi abi/contracts/vending.sol/VendingMachine.json \
  --network fuji \
  vending
```

Replace `<YOUR FUJI SMART CONTRACT ADDRESS>` with your deployed VendingMachine smart contract address from above.

If you are using Windows, replace the `\` characters in the above command with `^`.

This will output:

```text
✔ Subgraph slug · vending
✔ Directory to create the subgraph in · vending
✔ Ethereum network · fuji
✔ Contract address · <YOUR FUJI SMART CONTRACT ADDRESS>
✔ ABI file (path) · abi/contracts/vending.sol/VendingMachine.json
✔ Contract Name · VendingMachine
———
  Generate subgraph from ABI
  Write subgraph to directory
✔ Create subgraph scaffold
✔ Initialize subgraph repository
✔ Install dependencies with yarn
✔ Generate ABI and schema types with yarn codegen

Subgraph vending created in vending

Next steps:

  1. Run `graph auth` to authenticate with your deploy key.

  2. Type `cd vending` to enter the subgraph.

  3. Run `yarn deploy` to deploy the subgraph.

Make sure to visit the documentation on https://thegraph.com/docs/ for further information.
```

It shall create three files:

- `subgraph.yaml`: This is where the [subgraph manifest](https://thegraph.academy/developers/working-with-the-graph/) is stored
- `schema.graphql`: This defines the data to be stored and how it can be queried using GraphQL
- `src/mapping.ts`: This [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/) file defines the mapping between blockchain events to the schema entities

## Creating the project in Subgraph Studio

First, you will want to head over to the Subgraph Studio at <https://thegraph.com/studio/>.

![Login to Subgraph Studio](./assets/the-graph-deploy-a-subgraph-for-an-avalanche-smart-contract-login-to-subgraph-studio-6.png)

Click on the **Connect Wallet** button. Choose a Metamask wallet to login with. Once you are authenticated, you shall see the below screen, where you can create your first subgraph.

![Create your first subgraph](./assets/the-graph-deploy-a-subgraph-for-an-avalanche-smart-contract-create-your-first-subgraph-7.png)

Next, you need to give your subgraph a name. Give the name as **vending**. Once that's done, you will see this screen:

![Subgraph dashboard](./assets/the-graph-deploy-a-subgraph-for-an-avalanche-smart-contract-subgraph-dashboard-8.png)

On this screen, you can see details about the subgraph like your deploy key, the subgraph slug and status.

## Deploying the subgraph

Before you can deploy your subgraph, you need to get your deploy key from <https://thegraph.com/studio/subgraph/vending/>. This is used to authenticate your account with the Subgraph Studio.

Run the following commands to set your deploy key.

```text
cd vending
graph auth --studio <DEPLOY_KEY>
```

You should see the following output:

```text
Deploy key set for https://api.studio.thegraph.com/deploy/
```

Once that is done, you can run `yarn deploy` to deploy the subgraph to Subgraph Studio. When you are prompted for a version label, you can choose `v1.0.0`. You should see the following output:

```text
yarn run v1.22.11
$ graph deploy --node https://api.studio.thegraph.com/deploy/ vending
✔ Version Label (e.g. v0.0.1) · 1.0.0
