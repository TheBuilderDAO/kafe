# GitHub Workflows - publish

This GitHub Action is responsible for publishing the guides after they have been approved by the designated reviewers set by the Builder DAO admins.

## Triggers

```yaml
workflow_dispatch:
  inputs:
    slug:
      description: 'The slug of the tutorial to publish'
      required: true
    environment:
      description: 'Environment to run tests against'
      type: environment
      required: true

pull_request_target:
  types:
    - closed
```

This action has two possible triggers. The first is to use the `workflow_dispatch` trigger. This trigger is used to dispatch the action to the right environment. Only collabrators can trigger this action. The second way is to use the `pull_request_target` trigger. This is used to trigger the action when a pull request is closed, as It's merged to the `dev` or `main` branch.

## Jobs

### get_proposal_slug:

In this job, we get the slug of the proposal from the PR branch name.
The branch name is in the format of `tutorials/.` We match the slug using a regular expression (regex).

```js
const headBranch = context.payload.pull_request.head.ref;
const regex = /tutorials\/([A-z0-9]+(?:[_-][A-z0-9]+)*)/;
const slug = headBranch.match(regex);
return (slug && slug[1]) || '';
```

#### Output

The expected output of this job is the slug of the proposal, in lower-kebab-case.

### fetch_proposal:

In this job, we fetch the proposal from the Builder DAO CLI tool. And we are assigning as a variable to the context.

```bash
builderdao proposal get -s $SLUG
REVIEWER1=$(builderdao proposal get -s $SLUG -k reviewer1 --skip-ceramic)
REVIEWER2=$(builderdao proposal get -s $SLUG -k reviewer2 --skip-ceramic)
PROPOSAL_ID=$(builderdao proposal get -s $SLUG -k id --skip-ceramic)
PROPOSAL_STATE=$(builderdao proposal get -s $SLUG -k state --skip-ceramic)
REVIEWER1_GITHUBNAME=$(builderdao reviewer get -p $REVIEWER1 -k githubName)
REVIEWER2_GITHUBNAME=$(builderdao reviewer get -p $REVIEWER2 -k githubName)
```

## publish_tutorial:

In this Job we publish the tutorial via BuilderDAO CLI tool.

```yaml
- id: publish_tutorial
  env:
    SLUG: ${{ needs.get_proposal_slug.outputs.slug }}
    ARWEAVE_WALLET: ${{ secrets.ARWEAVE_WALLET }}
    ARWEAVE_APP_NAME: ${{ secrets.ARWEAVE_APP_NAME }}
    ARWEAVE_HOST: ${{ secrets.ARWEAVE_HOST }}
    ARWEAVE_PORT: ${{ secrets.ARWEAVE_PORT }}
    ARWEAVE_PROTOCOL: ${{ secrets.ARWEAVE_PROTOCOL }}
    CERAMIC_NODE_URL: ${{ secrets.CERAMIC_NODE_URL }}
    CERAMIC_SEED: ${{ secrets.CERAMIC_SEED }}
  run: |
    builderdao tutorial publish $SLUG
```

There are a few variables that we need to pass to the publish job. The environment set by the `workflow_dispatch` trigger is utilized here. If the trigger `pull_request_target` is merged to the `main` branch, we use the **Production** environment. If it's merged to the `dev` branch, use the **Preview** environment.

The internals of `builderdao tutorial publish $SLUG` is explained here.
