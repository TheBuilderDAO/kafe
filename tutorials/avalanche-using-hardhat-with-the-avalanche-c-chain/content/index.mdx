## Introduction

[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org) is a suite of tools that together provides us with a development environment that assists developers to easily manage and automate common tasks around building smart contracts and dApps. Hardhat can be used to compile, deploy, test, and debug smart contracts. It is very similar to [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) in this regard.

What differentiates Hardhat from Truffle is that it provides developers with a seamless experience for working with and debugging complex Solidity smart contracts with the help of plugins that offer powerful extensibility.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Hardhat with the Avalanche C-Chain. The C-Chain is an instance of the EVM ([Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/)). Being an instance of the EVM makes the Avalanche C-Chain very attractive as it can run the smart contract projects already written in Solidity.

## Prerequisites

Please make sure that you have completed the tutorials:

- [Avash Installation](https://learn.figment.io/tutorials/local-avalanche-network-using-avash)

## Requirements

For the smooth completion of this tutorial, we need the following software to be already present on your system:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) (12.x+)

## Creating a Hardhat project

The first step is to create a directory for your project where you will initialize our new Hardhat project. You can do this using the following command:

    mkdir avalanche-hardhat-tutorial && cd avalanche-hardhat-tutorial
    npm init -y

You should see a newly created directory named `avalanche-hardhat-tutorial` with a file `package.json` inside it:

```json
{
  "name": "avalanche-hardhat-tutorial",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

Now we go on to install Hardhat as one of our project dependencies with the following command:

```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

After the installation is done, type the following command to make the current directory a Hardhat project:

```bash
npx hardhat
```

You should be greeted with such a prompt by Hardhat:

```text

Welcome to Hardhat v2.2.1

? What do you want to do? …
Create a sample project
▸ Create an empty hardhat.config.js
Quit
```

Choose to create an empty `hardhat.config.js` and there you have it, your current directory is now a Hardhat project!

## Adding Avash network configuration to Hardhat

Now, in order for our Hardhat project to communicate with our local Avalanche network bootstrapped by Avash, we need to provide Hardhat with appropriate network configuration. For that, add the following properties to the module.exports block of `hardhat.config.js`:

```javascript
defaultNetwork: "avash",
networks: {
  avash: {
    url: 'http://localhost:9650/ext/bc/C/rpc',
    gasPrice: 225000000000,
    chainId: 43112,
    accounts: [
      "0x56289e99c94b6912bfc12adc093c9b51124f0dc54ac7a766b2bc5ccf558d8027",
      "0x7b4198529994b0dc604278c99d153cfd069d594753d471171a1d102a10438e07",
      "0x15614556be13730e9e8d6eacc1603143e7b96987429df8726384c2ec4502ef6e",
      "0x31b571bf6894a248831ff937bb49f7754509fe93bbd2517c9c73c4144c0e97dc",
      "0x6934bef917e01692b789da754a0eae31a8536eb465e7bff752ea291dad88c675",
      "0xe700bdbdbc279b808b1ec45f8c2370e4616d3a02c336e68d85d4668e08f53cff",
      "0xbbc2865b76ba28016bc2255c7504d000e046ae01934b04c694592a6276988630",
      "0xcdbfd34f687ced8c6968854f8a99ae47712c4f4183b78dcc4a903d1bfe8cbf60",
      "0x86f78c5416151fe3546dece84fda4b4b1e36089f2dbc48496faf3a950f16157c",
      "0x750839e9dbbd2a0910efe40f50b2f3b2f2f59f5580bb4b83bd8c1201cf9a010a"
    ]
  },
},
```

- The network url we provide points to the localhost and the RPC endpoint, this is the test network launched by Avash.
- The gas price of `225000000000` is the current gas price of the network - anything less and the transactions will fail, stating that the transaction is under-priced.
- `43112` is the id for the chain created by Avash. This value is hardcoded in Avash.
- The list of accounts we are providing above are randomly generated addresses on the network. When it comes to Avash, unlike on Avalanche mainnet and the Fuji testnet, these developer addresses come loaded with lots AVAX and so we don't need to fund them from a faucet. The balances are reset every time a new Avash network is created.

## Adding and compiling a smart contract

Hardhat looks for contracts to compile within the `contracts` directory. So let's go ahead and create this directory:

```bash
mkdir contracts
```

In the `contracts` directory we just created, create a new file called `Storage.sol` and add the following solidity code to it:

```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity >=0.4.22 <0.8.0;

/**
* @title Storage
* @dev Store & retrieve the value in a variable
*/
contract Storage {

  uint256 number;

  /**
  * @dev Store value in variable
  * @param num value to store
  */
  function store(uint256 num) public {
    number = num;
  }

  /**
  * @dev Return value
  * @return value of 'number'
  */
  function retrieve() public view returns (uint256){
    return number;
  }
}
```

`Storage` is a solidity smart contract that lets us write a number to the blockchain via the `store` function and then read the number back from the blockchain via the `retrieve` function.

To compile the Storage.sol smart contract we just added to our project, use the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

After the successful execution of the command, the smart contract should now be compiled!

## Using the Hardhat console

For the rest of the tutorial, we're going to use the Hardhat console to deploy and interact with our smart contract. To successfully use the Hardhat console for our purposes, we need to install a couple of Hardhat plugins, namely [`hardhat-ethers`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers) and [`hardhat-waffle`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle). Install them using the following commands:

    npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers 'ethers@^5.0.0'
    npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle 'ethereum-waffle@^3.0.0' @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers 'ethers@^5.0.0'

After these plugins are installed, we need to tell Hardhat to use them by requiring `hardhat-waffle` at the beginning of the Hardhat configuration file we created earlier:

```javascript
require('@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle');
```

Now, the file should look like this:

```javascript
require('@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle');

/**
 * @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig
 */
module.exports = {
  solidity: '0.7.3',
  defaultNetwork: 'avash',
  networks: {
    avash: {
      url: 'http://localhost:9650/ext/bc/C/rpc',
      gasPrice: 225000000000,
      chainId: 43112,
      accounts: [
        '0x56289e99c94b6912bfc12adc093c9b51124f0dc54ac7a766b2bc5ccf558d8027',
        '0x7b4198529994b0dc604278c99d153cfd069d594753d471171a1d102a10438e07',
        '0x15614556be13730e9e8d6eacc1603143e7b96987429df8726384c2ec4502ef6e',
        '0x31b571bf6894a248831ff937bb49f7754509fe93bbd2517c9c73c4144c0e97dc',
        '0x6934bef917e01692b789da754a0eae31a8536eb465e7bff752ea291dad88c675',
        '0xe700bdbdbc279b808b1ec45f8c2370e4616d3a02c336e68d85d4668e08f53cff',
        '0xbbc2865b76ba28016bc2255c7504d000e046ae01934b04c694592a6276988630',
        '0xcdbfd34f687ced8c6968854f8a99ae47712c4f4183b78dcc4a903d1bfe8cbf60',
        '0x86f78c5416151fe3546dece84fda4b4b1e36089f2dbc48496faf3a950f16157c',
        '0x750839e9dbbd2a0910efe40f50b2f3b2f2f59f5580bb4b83bd8c1201cf9a010a',
      ],
    },
  },
};
```

We're now ready to deploy our smart contract and interact with it!

## Deploying smart contracts using Hardhat console

To deploy our smart contract and to interact with it, we're gonna be using an interactive JavaScript console provided by Hardhat, which is called Hardhat console. Hardhat console is geared more towards providing us with quick local development and testing environment than writing scripts to do the same.

> Ensure that the local Avalanche network outlined in the `Setup a local Avalanche network using Avash` tutorial is running properly. Follow that other tutorial to completion, however, do not exit the Avash console after running the Lua script. Leave it running & in a separate terminal window, follow these instructions.

To fire up the Hardhat console, we use:

```text
npx hardhat console
```

We'll be greeted with an interactive console environment that looks like this:

```text
Welcome to Node.js v14.16.1.
Type ".help" for more information.
>
```

Now we go on and type in the following snippets of code to deploy and interact with our Storage smart contract. After you input each line of code, press "Enter" to execute the same.

In order to get an instance of the `Storage.sol` contract using Hardhat, we use the `getContractFactory` function from `hre`, the Hardhat Runtime Environment :

```javascript
const Storage = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory('Storage');
```

This will return `undefined` !

Here, `undefined` does not mean that the instruction we executed has failed. Instead, it's `undefined` because we stored the return value into the Storage constant and there's nothing to be printed out into the console. We could verify that the command executed successfully by logging the contents of the Storage constant with :

```javascript
console.log(Storage);
```

> What you see below is a Javascript representation of the compiled smart contract - you don't need to understand everything you see in the logged output. We print it out to demonstrate that the instruction was executed successfully.

![](./assets/avalanche-using-hardhat-with-the-avalanche-c-chain-image-1.png)

Now we go on to deploy the Storage contract we just retrieved, using:

```javascript
const storage = await Storage.deploy();
```

Again, this returns `undefined` !

Before we start interacting with the smart contract, we need to wait for the contract to be deployed successfully using :

```javascript
await storage.deployed();
```

This will return a lot of output, which is the internal representation of the smart contract in JavaScript.\
The following example has been truncated:

```javascript
Contract {
  interface: Interface {
    fragments: [ [FunctionFragment], [FunctionFragment] ],
    _abiCoder: AbiCoder { coerceFunc: null },
    functions: {
      'retrieve()': [FunctionFragment],
      'store(uint256)': [FunctionFragment]
    },
    errors: {},
    events: {},
    structs: {},
    deploy: ConstructorFragment {
      name: null,
      type: 'constructor',
      inputs: [],
      payable: false,
      stateMutability: 'nonpayable',
      gas: null,
      _isFragment: true
    },
    _isInterface: true
  },
```

## Interacting with smart contracts using Hardhat console

To store our favourite magical number into the blockchain, we call the store function of the deployed contract:

```javascript
await storage.store(333);
```

This outputs the Javascript representation of the transaction details:

```javascript
{
  hash: '0xaae491304254fce18fc3ff77f5891feef69035d05eb93c6b542823f948426ac4',
  type: 0,
  accessList: null,
  blockHash: null,
  blockNumber: null,
  transactionIndex: null,
  confirmations: 0,
  from: '0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC',
  gasPrice: BigNumber { _hex: '0x34630b8a00', _isBigNumber: true },
  gasLimit: BigNumber { _hex: '0xaa26', _isBigNumber: true },
  to: '0x4Ac1d98D9cEF99EC6546dEd4Bd550b0b287aaD6D',
  value: BigNumber { _hex: '0x00', _isBigNumber: true },
  nonce: 5,
  data: '0x6057361d000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000014d',
  r: '0x2be3e63b57eb1dd045361317e5380af910527a03b8e00cbde6226350d908d698',
  s: '0x6c45b5adabfd6cabde520a8f4a649b639f59e1e9fe3234713bb8152515bcf9d0',
  v: 86259,
  creates: null,
  chainId: 43112,
  wait: [Function (anonymous)]
}
```

Now, we're all set to read the number we just stored into our contract and print it out, using:

```javascript
let i = await storage.retrieve();
console.log(i.toNumber());
```

Run the code again and you should now see the output `333` printed to the console.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've successfully created a new Hardhat project. Within the Hardhat project, we added a new smart contract, then compiled it using Hardhat. Finally, we deployed the contract and interacted with it using the Hardhat console.

Congratulations on making it to the end of this tutorial!
