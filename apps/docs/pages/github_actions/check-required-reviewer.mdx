# GitHub Actions - check-required-reviewer

This Action is responsible for checking the existing pull request reviewers by filtering the Input `AUTHOR` GitHub name.
This Action runs as [composite action.](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-action)

To get a pull request review list from GitHub API, you need to provide the following inputs:

## Inputs

```
  AUTHOR:  # id of the input
    description: 'Reviewer Github Login'
    required: true
  GITHUB_TOKEN:
    required: true
  OWNER:
    default: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
  REPO:
    default: ${{ github.event.repository.name }}
  PR_NUMBER:
    default: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
```

We are using Github Graphql API to get the list of pull request reviews.

```Graphql
  query($name: String!, $owner: String!, $pr_number: Int!, $author: String!) {
    repository(owner: $owner, name: $name) {
      pullRequest(number: $pr_number) {
        reviews(author: $author, last: 1) {
          nodes {
            state
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

If the `$AUTHOR` is not in the list of the pull request reviews, we will return `PENDING` as the result.

## Outputs

```
  state:
    description: "Status of the review"
    value: ${{ steps.result.outputs.state }}
```
