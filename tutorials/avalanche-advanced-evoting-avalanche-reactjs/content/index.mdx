## Introduction

In the tutorial [Making advanced e-voting dApp](https://learn.figment.io/tutorials/making-advanced-e-voting-dapp-avalanche-fuji-using-trufle) we have learned to build smart contracts, deploy them on Avalanche and interact with them using jQuery.

We will generate [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) boilerplate code using `create-react-app`, which we will modify for our dApp frontend. React is a good choice for efficient, developer-friendly blockchain interactions. For the backend, [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.4/) smart contracts will be deployed to the [Avalanche](advanced-evoting-avalanche-reactjs.md) blockchain using [Truffle Suite](https://www.trufflesuite.com).

Truffle Suite is a toolkit for launching decentralized applications (dApps) on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchains like Avalanche. With Truffle you can write and compile smart contracts, build artifacts, run migrations and interact with deployed contracts. This tutorial illustrates how Truffle can be used with Avalanche's C-Chain, which is an instance of the EVM.

## Prerequisites

- You've created an account on [DataHub](https://datahub.figment.io/sign_up?service=avalanche).
- Basic familiarity with [Avalanche's architecture](https://docs.avax.network/learn/platform-overview) and smart contracts.
- Basic familiarity with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org).

## Requirements

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) >= 10.16 and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) >= 5.6 installed.
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle), which can be installed globally with `npm install -g truffle`
- Metamask extension added to the browser, which must only be obtained from the official Metamask website : <https://metamask.io>. **Do not download Metamask from an unofficial source**.

## Initializing the working directory

The client-side of our dApp is made using **ReactJS**. Smart contracts will be made using **Solidity** language and will be deployed on the **Avalanche** network with **Truffle Suite**. Therefore, we need to set up our working directory according to ReactJS and Truffle, to make the development process smoother.

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where we will create the application. Usually, this will be inside our user home directory but can be located wherever is practical. On most Linux distributions this will change into /home/ . On macOS it will be /Users/. On Windows the user directories are located in C:\Users.

```bash
cd ~
```

## Setting up the ReactJS project

Create a new react app using npx. npx is a npm package runner (x probably stands for eXecute). The typical use is to download and run a package temporarily or for trials. Using npx to execute the package binaries for create-react-app will generate a new React app scaffold in the specified directory.

```text
npx create-react-app avalanche-voting
```

Move to the newly created directory and install the basic dependencies.

```text
cd avalanche-voting
npm install --save dotenv web3 @truffle/contract @truffle/hdwallet-provider
```

Open the file `index.html` file inside of the `public` directory and replace the existing code with the following HTML :

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <title>Avalanche Elections</title>
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
    />
  </head>

  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Open the file `App.js` inside of the `src` directory and replace the existing code with the following code:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

// 1. Importing other modules

class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      web3: null,
      account: null,
      mainInstance: null,
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.init();
  }

  async init() {
    // 2. Load web3
    // 3. Load Account
    // 4. Load Smart-Contract instance
  }

  render() {
    return <div>Avalanche evoting application</div>;
  }
}
export default App;
```

This `App` component has a constructor to declare and initialize the state properties. `web3` is an instance of the `Metamask` provider for interacting with the Avalanche network, `account` is a user address and `mainInstance` is the instance of our smart contract.

Open the file `index.js` inside of the `src` directory and replace the existing code with the following code:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
);
```

React project setup is now complete.

## Setting up the Truffle project

Run the following command in the project root directory, to create a boilerplate for the Truffle project.

```text
truffle init
```

This will set up the initial project structure. Solidity code will be stored in the `contracts` directory. Deployment functions written in JavaScript will be stored in the `migrations` folder. By default, the `/build/contracts` folder contains information about the compiled and deployed contract, like the ABI, in JSON format. These meta-files are commonly referred to as `artifacts`.

There is also 1 **config** file created by the above command, which is, **truffle-config.js**. In this file, there is a lot of information regarding how to deploy contracts, how to choose a network to deploy them, and many others. Therefore, we should preserve this file for reference. So, use the below command to make a copy of this file. This would create a copy named `truffle-config-default.js`.

```text
cp truffle-config.js truffle-config-default.js
```

Now we will update the `truffle-config.js` file, with the information needed to deploy the smart contract on the Fuji test network. This file helps us in connecting to the DataHub Avalanche node, and we will require an Avalanche API key along with an Avalanche wallet mnemonic for deploying the contract on the network.

```javascript
require('dotenv').config();
const HDWalletProvider = require('@truffle/hdwallet-provider');

// Account credentials from which our contract will be deployed
const MNEMONIC = process.env.MNEMONIC;

// API key of your Datahub account for Avalanche Fuji test network
const DATAHUB_API_KEY = process.env.DATAHUB_API_KEY;

module.exports = {
  contracts_build_directory: './src/build/contracts',
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: '127.0.0.1',
      port: 7545,
      network_id: '*',
    },
    fuji: {
      provider: function () {
        return new HDWalletProvider({
          mnemonic: MNEMONIC,
          providerOrUrl: `https://avalanche--fuji--rpc.datahub.figment.io/apikey/${DATAHUB_API_KEY}/ext/bc/C/rpc/`,
        });
      },
      network_id: '*',
      gas: 3000000,
      gasPrice: 470000000000,
      skipDryRun: true,
    },
  },
  compilers: {
    solc: {
      version: '0.8.0',
    },
  },
};
```

Note that we're setting the `gasPrice` and `gas` to the appropriate values for the Avalanche C-Chain. Here, you can see that we have used `contracts_build_directory` to change the default location of `artifacts` from the project root directory to the `src` folder. This is because React cannot access files that are present outside the `src` folder.

## Get Avalanche credentials

For deploying smart contracts we need two things: A node connected to the Avalanche network and an account with few AVAX. To access the DataHub Avalanche node through RPC (Remote Procedure Call), we need an API key. Visit the [Avalanche Services Dashboard](https://datahub.figment.io/services/avalanche) on DataHub to get an Avalanche specific API key.

![](./assets/avalanche-advanced-evoting-avalanche-reactjs-image-1.png)

Now we need an Avalanche wallet, where we would keep our funds, required for all the transactions on the network. So, visit [here](https://wallet.avax.network) and create an account. Save the mnemonic in a secure place (we would need it later). Instructions to add funds will be provided later in the tutorial.

## Add .env file

Create a `.env` file in the project root folder. Please take a note that dot (.) is necessary for the `.env` file name. Now copy your Datahub's Avalanche API key and the Avalanche wallet's mnemonic in the .env file as shown below. In the .env file, **MNEMONIC** should be enclosed within double-quotes (" "). If you are facing any difficulty in setting up .env file then please refer to **Extra Guides** on [dotenv and .env](https://docs.figment.io/network-documentation/extra-guides/dotenv-and-.env).

```text
MNEMONIC="<avalanche-wallet-mnemonic>"
DATAHUB_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

<Hint type="warning">
  Never share or commit your .env file. It contains your credentials like
  mnemonics and API key. Therefore, it is advised to add .env to your .gitignore
  file.
</Hint>

Our project setup is now complete.

To confirm that we are on the same page, run the following command in the project root folder.

```text
npm start
```

It might take few seconds, to show output as in the image below.

![](./assets/avalanche-advanced-evoting-avalanche-reactjs-image-2.png)

In a browser, visit the URL of our running dApp: <http://localhost:3000>. If you followed the above steps, you would see the page as shown below.

## Create Election smart contract

Create the file `Election.sol` (`.sol` stands for Solidity) inside of the `contracts` directory and paste the following code:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity >=0.8.0;

contract Election {
  // Election details will be stored in these variables
  string public name;
  string public description;

  // Structure of candidate standing in the election
  struct Candidate {
    uint256 id;
    string name;
    uint256 voteCount;
  }

  // Storing candidates in a map
  mapping(uint256 => Candidate) public candidates;

  // Storing address of those voters who already voted
  mapping(address => bool) public voters;

  // Number of candidates in standing in the election
  uint256 public candidatesCount = 0;

  // Setting of variables and data, during the creation of election contract
  constructor(string[] memory _nda, string[] memory _candidates) public {
    require(_candidates.length > 0, "There should be atleast 1 candidate.");
    name = _nda[0];
    description = _nda[1];
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _candidates.length; i++) {
      addCandidate(_candidates[i]);
    }
  }

  // Private function to add a candidate
  function addCandidate(string memory _name) private {
    candidates[candidatesCount] = Candidate(candidatesCount, _name, 0);
    candidatesCount++;
  }

  // Public vote function for voting a candidate
  function vote(uint256 _candidate) public {
    require(!voters[msg.sender], "Voter has already Voted!");
    require(
      _candidate < candidatesCount && _candidate >= 0,
      "Invalid candidate to Vote!"
    );
    voters[msg.sender] = true;
    candidates[_candidate].voteCount++;
  }
}
```

`Election` is a Solidity contract that lets us view the name and description, the candidates standing in an election, and vote for them. For this dApp, we will be accessing the deployed Election contracts using their `address` and `ABI`. This Solidity code is what will be deployed to the blockchain, each time we create a new election.

**Let's understand this smart contract**

The code for smart contract is everything within `contract Election { }`.

**Basic fields about election** - This block of code would be storing basic fields of each `Election` contract. Fields include `name` and `description`.

```solidity
// Election details will be stored in these variables
string public name;
string public description;
```

**Storing candidate details** - The `Candidate` struct consists of the data fields `id`, `name` and `voteCount`. We will define a mapping between an unsigned integer (`uint`) and each instance of a Candidate. This will enable us to refer to each candidate by its index within the mapping - `candidates[n]`, where `n` is the corresponding `uint` value.

```solidity
// Structure of candidate standing in the election
struct Candidate {
  uint256 id;
  string name;
  uint256 voteCount;
}

// Storing candidates in a map
mapping(uint256 => Candidate) public candidates;
```

**Storing address of voters who have already voted and the number of candidates** - `voters` is a mapping between the address of the voter and a boolean. In Solidity, the default boolean value is `false`, so if the return value of `voters(address)` is `false` we can understand that this address has not voted. `true` indicates that the account has voted already.

```solidity
// Storing address of those voters who already voted
mapping(address => bool) public voters;

// Number of candidates in standing in the election
uint public candidatesCount = 0;
```

**Constructor call and adding candidates to the election** - When a smart contract is deployed on Avalanche, the first function to be called is the `constructor()` function. Whatever we want to initialize in our Solidity smart contract, we do it inside the `constructor()` function. We will be adding a name, description, and candidates to the election. Here, `addCandidate()` is a private function, so that it cannot be called publicly. This function takes `name` and `description` as a single array named `_nda` in the first argument and candidates' name as an array in the second argument.

```solidity
// Setting of variables and data, during the creation of election contract
constructor (string[] memory _nda, string[] memory _candidates) public {
  require(_candidates.length > 0, "There should be atleast 1 candidate.");
  name = _nda[0];
  description = _nda[1];
  for(uint i = 0; i < _candidates.length; i++) {
    addCandidate(_candidates[i]);
  }
}

// Private function to add a candidate
function addCandidate (string memory _name) private {
  candidates[candidatesCount] = Candidate(candidatesCount, _name, 0);
  candidatesCount ++;
}
```

**Voting candidates in an election** - We made a `vote()` function. It takes `candidateId` as an argument and increments the vote of the respective candidate. It requires two things, a voter should not have voted in the particular election by checking boolean across the `voters` mapping and `candidateId` should be a valid one, i.e. `0 <= candidateId < candiatesCount`.

```solidity
// Public vote function for voting a candidate
function vote (uint _candidate) public {
  require(!voters[msg.sender], "Voter has already Voted!");
  require(_candidate < candidatesCount && _candidate >= 0, "Invalid candidate to Vote!");
  voters[msg.sender] = true;
  candidates[_candidate].voteCount++;
}
```

## Create MainContract smart contract

Create the file `MainContract.sol` inside of the `contracts` directory and paste the following code:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity >=0.8.0;

import './Election.sol';

contract MainContract {
  uint public electionId = 0;
  mapping (uint => address) public Elections;

  function createElection (string[] memory _nda, string[] memory _candidates) public {
    Election election = new Election(_nda, _candidates);
    Elections[electionId] = address(election);
    electionId++;
  }
}
```

`MainContract.sol` is the entry point of our dApp. To create a new election, we need to call the `createElection()` function from this deployed contract. It will maintain the total number of election contracts deployed, their address on the network and will also help in deploying them. We also [import](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.4/layout-of-source-files.html?highlight=import#syntax-and-semantics) `Elections.sol`.

Here `electionId` is used for assigning ID's to each election that a user creates and is incremented for using it while creating the next election. Also, `Elections` is a public mapping between `electionId` and the address of the deployed election contract.

```solidity
uint public electionId = 0;
mapping (uint => address) public Elections;
```

We have made a `createElection()` function which will be used to deploy our `Election` smart contract. This function takes `name` and `description` as a single array named `_nda` in the first argument and candidates' name as an array in the second argument.

```solidity
function createElection (string[] memory _nda, string[] memory _candidates) public {
  Election election = new Election(_nda, _candidates);
  Elections[electionId] = address(election);
  electionId++;
}
```

The `Election` contract is deployed on the network using the `new` keyword, which deploys the contract, initializes the contract's variables, runs the `constructor()` function and returns the **address** of the newly deployed contract to the caller. Then the address is stored in the `Elections` mapping. Once the election contract is deployed successfully, `electionId` is incremented.

## Create a file for migrating contracts

Create a new file in the `migrations` directory named `2_deploy_contracts.js`, and add the following block of code. This handles deploying the `MainContract` and `Election` smart contract to the blockchain.

```solidity
const MainContract = artifacts.require("MainContract");

module.exports = function(deployer) {
  deployer.deploy(MainContract);
};
```

We are deploying only the `MainContract`, because the `Election` contract will be deployed by the `MainContract` itself during the runtime, using the function `createElection()`.

## Compile Contracts with Truffle

If we have altered the code within our Solidity source files or made new ones (like `Elections.sol`), we need to run `truffle compile` in the terminal, from inside the project root directory.

The expected output would look similar:

```text
Compiling your contracts...
===========================
> Compiling ./contracts/Election.sol
> Compiling ./contracts/MainContract.sol
> Compiling ./contracts/Migrations.sol

> Artifacts written to /home/guest/blockchain/avalanche-voting/build/contracts
> Compiled successfully using:
   - solc: 0.8.0+commit.c7dfd78e.Emscripten.clang
```

The compiled smart contracts are written as JSON files in the /src/build/contracts directory. These are the stored ABI and other necessary metadata - the artifacts.

<Hint type="info">
  ABI refers to Application Binary Interface, which is a standard for
  interacting with the smart contracts from outside the blockchain as well as
  contract-to-contract interaction. Please refer to the Solidity's documentation
  about ABI's here to learn more.
</Hint>

## Fund the account

When deploying smart contracts to the C-Chain, it will require some deployment cost. As you can see inside `truffle-config.js`, HDWallet Provider will help us in deploying on Fuji C-chain and deployment cost will be managed by the account whose mnemonic has been stored in the `.env` file. Therefore we need to fund the account.

We need funds in our C-Chain address, as smart contracts are deployed on C-Chain i.e. Contract-Chain. This address can easily be found on the [Avalanche Wallet](https://wallet.avax.network) dashboard. Avalanche network has 3 chains: X-Chain, P-Chain and C-Chain. The address of all these chains can be found by switching tabs at the bottom of the division, where there is a QR code. So, switch to C-Chain, and copy the address. Now fund your account using the faucet link [here](https://faucet.avax-test.network/) and paste your C-Chain address in the input field. Refer to the below image, to identify the address section.

![](./assets/avalanche-advanced-evoting-avalanche-reactjs-image-4.png)

<Hint type="info">
  You'll need to send at least 135422040 nAVAX to the account to cover the cost
  of contract deployments. Here nAVAX refers nano-AVAX i.e. billionth of an AVAX
  or simply 1 nAVAX = (1/1000,000,000) AVAX. Though funding through faucet would
  give you enough AVAX to run multiple deployments and transactions on the
  network.
</Hint>

## Run Migrations

Now everything is in place to run migrations and deploy the `MainContract`:

```text
truffle migrate --network fuji
```

This might take a while depending upon your internet connection or traffic on the network.

Note - For development purpose, we may deploy our contracts on the local network, by running Ganache (Truffle's local blockchain simulation) and using the command

```bash
truffle migrate --network development
```

On successful execution of this command, you should see:

```bash

If you didn't create an account on the C-Chain you'll see this error:

```text
Error: Expected parameter 'from' not passed to function.
```

If you didn't fund the account, you'll see this error:

```text
Error:  *** Deployment Failed ***

```

The information and ABI of the deployed contract are present in the `src/build/contract` directory as `Election.json`. Information like contract address, network info etc. could be found here.

## Building the user interface

We have already set up our React project directory. The client-side files to interact with the Avalanche blockchain are present in the `src` directory. First, we will make a ReactJS component with of a couple of functions to connect our browser with the Avalanche network. These functions will be kept in a separate file named `BlockchainUtil.js`.

### BlockchainUtils Component

Create the file `BlockchainUtil.js` inside of the project `src` directory and paste the following code:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Web3 from 'web3';
import TruffleContract from '@truffle/contract';

export class GetWeb3 extends React.Component {
  async getWeb3() {
    let web3 = window.web3;

    if (typeof web3 !== 'undefined') {
      // Setup Web3 Provider
      this.web3Provider = web3.currentProvider;
      this.web3 = new Web3(web3.currentProvider);
      return this.web3;
    } else {
      this.isWeb3 = false;
    }
  }
}

export class GetContract extends React.Component {
  async getContract(web3, contractJson) {
    // Setup Contract
    this.contract = await TruffleContract(contractJson);
    this.contract.setProvider(web3.currentProvider);
    return await this.contract.deployed();
  }
}

export class GetAccount extends React.Component {
  async getAccount(web3) {
    return await web3.eth.getAccounts();
  }
}
```

### Updating App.js

`App.js` is the entry point of our React application. Therefore, we will need to update `App.js` with the components which we want to show in our application. As we move ahead and build components, we will update `App.js` and import the components so that we can make use of their functionality.

So, now add the following line under the `//Importing...` section of `App.js` to import `BlockchainUtil.js` module.

```javascript
// 1. Importing other modules
import { GetWeb3, GetContract, GetAccount } from './BlockchainUtil';
```

Paste the following code inside the `init()` function of `App.js`

```javascript
// 2. Load web3
const Web3 = new GetWeb3();
this.web3 = await Web3.getWeb3();
this.setState({ web3: this.web3 });

// 3. Load Account
const Account = new GetAccount();
this.account = await Account.getAccount(this.web3);
this.setState({ account: this.account[0] });

// 4. Load Contract
const Contract = new GetContract();
this.mainInstance = await Contract.getContract(this.web3, contractJson);
this.setState({ mainInstance: this.mainInstance });
```

### CreateElection Component

Now let's make a component that will create new elections using our deployed smart contract. Create the file `CreateElection.js` inside of the project `src` directory and paste the following code. The code is commented to draw attention to the important parts.

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import App from './App';

class CreateElection extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.onChangeElectionName = this.onChangeElectionName.bind(this);
    this.onChangeDescription = this.onChangeDescription.bind(this);
    this.onSubmit = this.onSubmit.bind(this);

    // These state variables would maintain inputs of the form

### ActiveElections Component

Create the file `ActiveElections.js` inside of the project `src` directory and paste the following code:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Loader } from 'rimble-ui';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

import App from './App';
import ElectionJSON from './build/contracts/Election.json';
import VoteModal from './VoteModal';

// Election component for organising election details
var Election = props => (
  <tr>
    <td>{props.election.electionId}</td>

    <td>
      {props.election.electionName} <br />
      <font className="text-muted" size="2">
        <b>{props.election.electionDescription}</b>
      </font>
      <br />
      <font className="text-muted" size="2">

    </td>

    <td style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>{props.candidateComponent}</td>

    <td style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
      {!props.election.hasVoted ? (
        // Vote Modal would be mounted if the user has not voted
        <VoteModal election={props.election} candidates={props.candidates} />
      ) : (
        <font size="2" color="green">
          You have voted!
        </font>
      )}
    </td>
  </tr>
);

// Candidate component for organising candidate details of each candidate
var Candidates = props => (

    var eCount = await this.app.mainInstance.electionId();
    var elections = [],
      electionDetails = [],
      electionComponents = [];

    // Election details of every election created by MainContract
    for (var i = 0; i < eCount; i++) {
      elections[i] = await this.app.mainInstance.Elections(i);
      var election = await new this.app.web3.eth.Contract(
        ElectionJSON.abi,
        elections[i],
      );

      electionDetails[i] = [];

      // Boolean indicating wether the contract address has voted or not
      electionDetails[i].hasVoted = await election.methods

        candidateComponents = [];
      candidates[i] = [];
      candidateComponents[i] = [];

      for (var j = 0; j < candidatesCount; j++) {
        candidates[i].push(await election.methods.candidates(j).call());
        candidateComponents[i].push(
          <Candidates
            name={candidates[i][j][1]}
            voteCount={candidates[i][j][2]}
          />,
        );
      }

      // Saving the electionDetails in the form of a component
      electionComponents[i] = (

      );
    }

    this.setState({
      data: electionComponents,
      loading: false,
    });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      // Simple container to store table with election data
      <div className="container">
        <div style={{ float: 'right', marginBottom: '10px' }}>
          <img

      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ActiveElections;
```

### VoteModal Component

In the above component `ActiveElections.js`, we have used a component called `VoteModal` which contains the candidate details and a button to cast a vote. Now we will make this component available by creating a file named `VoteModal.js` inside the `src` directory. Once created, put the following code inside it :

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import {
  Box,
  Flex,
  Modal,
  Button,
  Text,
  Card,
  Radio,
  Field,
  Loader,
} from 'rimble-ui';

// Data like election and candidate details will be passed in the props by ActiveElections.js (parent)
function VoteModal(props) {
  // These are React Hooks and are used only for UX like opening and closing of Voting Modal and loaders
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
  const [loading, isLoading] = useState(false);

  // This Hook will be used to maintain the selected candidate ID by a voter
  const [cid, changeCid] = useState(0);

  const closeModal = e => {
    e.preventDefault();
    setIsOpen(false);
  };

  const openModal = e => {
    e.preventDefault();
    setIsOpen(true);
  };

  const onRadioChange = e => {
    changeCid(e.target.value);
  };

  // vote() function would be used to transact a vote
  const vote = async eid => {
    isLoading(true);
    await props.election.contractInstance.methods
      .vote(cid)
      .send({ from: props.election.account });
    isLoading(false);
  };

  var candid = [],
    candidVote = [];
  for (var i = 0; i < props.candidates.length; i++) {
    var candidDetail =
      props.candidates[i][1] + ' (' + props.candidates[i][2] + ')';

    candid.push(
      <Radio
        name="candidate"
        key={i}
        label={candidDetail}
        my={2}
        value={props.candidates[i][0]}
        onChange={onRadioChange}
      />,
    );

    candidVote.push(props.candidates[i][2]);
  }

  return (
    // This is a rimble-ui builtin modal for triggering vote() function
    <Box className="App" p={0}>
      <Box>
        <Button onClick={openModal}>Vote</Button>

        <Modal isOpen={isOpen}>
          <Card width={'420px'} p={0}>
            {/* Close icon to close the modal */}
            <Button.Text
              icononly
              icon={'Close'}
              color={'moon-gray'}
              position={'absolute'}
              top={0}
              right={0}
              mt={3}
              mr={3}
              onClick={closeModal}
            />

            {/* List of candidates with their vote count */}
            <Box p={4} mb={3}>
              <h3>{props.election.electionName}</h3>
              <Field label="Choose candidate from below">{candid}</Field>
            </Box>

            {/* Vote button to cast a vote */}
            <Flex
              px={4}
              py={3}
              borderTop={1}
              borderColor={'#E8E8E8'}
              justifyContent={'flex-end'}
            >
              {loading ? (
                <Loader size="40px" />
              ) : (
                <Button.Outline
                  onClick={() => {
                    vote(props.election.electionId);
                  }}
                >
                  Vote
                </Button.Outline>
              )}
            </Flex>
          </Card>
        </Modal>
      </Box>
    </Box>
  );
}

export default VoteModal;
```

### Integrating Components into App.js

Now we need to update our `App.js` file with all the components that we have made so far.

**Import Modules** - First import all the modules and components into the `App.js` file by appending the following code under the `// 1. Importing other modules` section.

```javascript
// 1. Importing other modules
import {
  BrowserRouter as Router,
  Route,
  Link,
  Redirect,
} from 'react-router-dom';
import CreateElection from './CreateElection';
import ActiveElections from './ActiveElections';
import contractJson from './build/contracts/MainContract.json';
```

**Load components** - Inside the `<div>` tag of `return()` function in `App.js`, replace the sample text (`Avalanche evoting`) with the the code of the following components.

```javascript
// For routing through the react application
<Router>
  {/* Default route to ActiveElections component */}
  <Route path="/" exact>
    <Redirect to="/active" />
  </Route>

  {/* Navbar */}
  <nav
    className="navbar navbar-dark shadow"
    style={{
      backgroundColor: '#1b2021',
      height: '60px',
      color: 'white',
      marginBottom: '50px',
    }}
  >
    {/* Link to Active election page (nav-header) */}
    <Link to="/active">
      <b style={{ cursor: 'pointer', color: 'white' }}>Avalanche Elections</b>
    </Link>

    {/* Account address on the right side of the navbar  */}
    <span style={{ float: 'right' }}>{this.state.account}</span>
  </nav>

  {/* Route to CreateElection page */}
  {
    <Route
      path="/createElection"
      exact
      component={() => <CreateElection account={this.state.account} />}
    />
  }

  {/* Route to Active election page */}
  {
    <Route
      path="/active"
      exact
      component={() => <ActiveElections account={this.state.account} />}
    />
  }
</Router>
```

We have used few other dependencies which we didn't install earlier. So, run the following command in the terminal of your project directory.

```text
npm install --save rimble-ui react-router-dom --force
```

<Hint type="info">
  Rimble UI library comes with a peer dependency of react@16.9.0 which is not
  the latest version of React that we are using i.e. react@17.0.2. Running the
  npm install command without the --force tag would cause an unable to resolve
  dependency tree conflict. Thus, the --force tag is used to override any type
  of conflicts and proceeds with the installation anyway. Another way to resolve
  this conflict is by using the --legacy-peer-deps tag instead, but this would
  ignore all peer dependencies which we do not require, as the conflict is only
  between react and rimble-ui.
</Hint>

Now go to the project root directory, i.e. `avalanche-voting` directory, and run the command `npm start`. The ReactJS server would start automatically. Visit <http://localhost:3000> in a browser to interact with the dApp frontend.

Don't forget to set up Metamask with Fuji testnet and also fund the account with Fuji C-Chain test tokens to vote. In the Metamask extension, add a custom RPC by clicking at the network dropdown in the centre of the extension. Fill in the details as shown in the below image. Put your Avalanche's specific Datahub's API key against **New RPC URL** field in place of `DATAHUB_API_KEY`

| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| Currency Symbol    | AVAX-C                                                                                |
| Block Explorer URL | <https://cchain.explorer.avax-test.network>                                           |

## Conclusion

You have successfully built a full-fledged e-voting dApp with advanced features like creating custom elections, voting in them and deployed the smart contract on the Fuji test network using Truffle Suite. Along with that, we have also built the client-side application using ReactJS for interacting with the network. From this tutorial, you have learned not only how to make make and deploy smart contracts but also how to integrate ReactJS with the blockchain using Truffle Suite.

## Next Steps

Now that we have built and deployed a voting dApp, we can make new elections with a title and description, and vote on them separately. Some recommended features to add would be the ability to add start and end dates for an election, declaring the winner after the election has ended, or UI enhancements like modal windows and styled buttons.
