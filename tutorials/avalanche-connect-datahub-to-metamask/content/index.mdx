# Setup

First, [create an account](https://datahub.figment.io/sign_up?service=avalanche) on DataHub. You'll get an email with a verification link. When you click it, you'll be signed into your DataHub dashboard.

# DataHub Dashboard

Once you're logged in to your [DataHub dashboard](https://datahub.figment.io/), find the `Available protocols` section and select Avalanche. This will bring you to the Avalanche dashboard. Our free tier for Avalanche has a limit of 200,000 requests per day. If you want to make more requests per day, you can upgrade to one of our [paid options](https://datahub.figment.io/services/avalanche/prices).

# Avalanche Dashboard

On the Avalanche dashboard, you'll data about your plan and your usage of Avalanche APIs.

Next, you'll see your API key. It will look something like this: `f81e193b9412a683af7101e964766c07`. This piece of information is used to authenticate you when you make calls to the Avalanche API. You must provide it when you make a call to an Avalanche API hosted by Figment.

As the table on the dashboard says, you can make an API call to Avalanche's mainnet at `avalanche--mainnet--rpc.datahub.figment.io`. You can make an API call to the Fuji testnet at `avalanche--fuji--rpc.datahub.figment.io`.

# Try it Out

Paste the following command into your computer's terminal to confirm that you can access the Avalanche API hosted by Figment. This `curl` is asking for the blockchainID of the X-Chain on the Fuji tesnet. Replace `APIKEYGOESHERE` with the API key you see on the Avalanche dashboard.

```text
curl --location --request POST 'https://avalanche--fuji--rpc.datahub.figment.io/apikey/APIKEYGOESHERE/ext/info' \--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \--data-raw '{    "jsonrpc":"2.0",    "id"     :1,    "method" :"info.getBlockchainID",    "params": {        "alias":"X"    }}'
```

If you are successfully able to POST to DataHub's full nodes then you should get the following response.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "blockchainID": "2JVSBoinj9C2J33VntvzYtVJNZdN2NKiwwKjcumHUWEb5DbBrm"
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

# Set up Metamask

Let's connect our Metamask wallet to the Avalanche API hosted by Figment. Open Metamask and select the network drop-down menu. Then, select `Custom RPC`:

Now, fill in the boxes with the following values, depending on whether you want to connect to mainnet or the Fuji testnet. Again, replace `APIKEYGOESHERE` with your API key from Figment.

# Mainnet Settings

- **Network Name**: Figment C-Chain Mainnet
- **New RPC URL**: `https://avalanche--mainnet--rpc.datahub.figment.io/apikey/APIKEYGOESHERE/ext/bc/C/rpc`
- **ChainID**: `0xa86a`
- **Symbol**: AVAX
- **Explorer**: `https://cchain.explorer.avax.network`

# Fuji Settings

- **Network Name**: Figment C-Chain Fuji
- **New RPC URL**: `https://avalanche--fuji--rpc.datahub.figment.io/apikey/APIKEYGOESHERE/ext/bc/C/rpc`
- **ChainID**: `0xa869`
- **Symbol**: AVAX
- **Explorer**: `https://cchain.explorer.avax-test.network`

After setting up all of the parameters, you should see this page, which shows your (empty) balance.
