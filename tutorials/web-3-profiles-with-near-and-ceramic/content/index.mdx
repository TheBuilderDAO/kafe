# Integrating Personas in Your Apps

{{description}}

## Introduction

It's a simple process to bring NEAR Persona data into your applications to use as you see fit. It's basically three steps:

- install a NPM package
- import the package and instantiate the Persona clas

  s
- call a method, passing it the name of the account you want data for

### Step 1: Install the NPM Package

Using yarn or npm (yarn shown here):

```text
yarn add @aluhning/get-personas-js
```

---

## Step 2: Instantiate the class

In your application code (e.g. React app):

```text
import Persona from '@aluhning/get-personas-js'
...
let persona = new Persona()
```

---

## Step 3: Retrieve the Personas Data

However you want to handle the data - calling following will return the persona's data to consume as needed in your app :

- accountId (change) - the string representation of the NEAR account you want persona data for. Can pass it in as a variable or directly as a string - e.g. 'jimbean.near'
- profile (don't change) - the alias of the Ceramic data model definition that is storing the data

```text
let personaData = await persona.getData('profile', accountId)
```

---

That will return the following object. If you stored the data in personaData, you'd access the avatar (uploaded) by referring to personaData.avatar
