# Interacting with the Crowdfunding Smart Contracts

Welcome to the last tutorial in this three part series on creating a crowdfunding smart contract on Celo. In this last part, we're going to write Javascript code in order to interact with the smart contract we wrote and deployed in the previous two parts.

Now that we have our smart contract on the Celo test network, it's time to use it!

# Prerequisites

You will need the smart contracts we wrote in part 1, and the deployments you made in part 2. Therefore, for the code in this tutorial to work you will need to have completed the prior two tutorials.

# Setup

The first step is to create a Javascript file to write our smart contract interactions in. In the root of the `celo-crowdfunding` folder, create a file named `interact.js`.

We will use the packages we installed via NPM in the first tutorial here. We will also need one additional module, BigNumber, in order to work with the large numbers the Celo blockchain uses.

In the terminal, run `npm install bignumber.js`. That's it for the setup of this step!

# Importing our modules

The first step for interacting with our smart contracts is importing the modules we'll need for our script.

At the top of the `interact.js` file, write the following:

```js
const Web3 = require('web3');
const ContractKit = require('@celo/contractkit');
const web3 = new Web3('https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org');
const kit = ContractKit.newKitFromWeb3(web3);
const CeloCrowdfund = require('./build/contracts/CeloCrowdfund.json');
const Project = require('./build/contracts/Project.json');
const BigNumber = require('bignumber.js');

require('dotenv').config({ path: '.env' });
```

We will use all of these modules later on in order to interact with the crowdfunding contracts we previously made.

# Getting our contract

The next thing we want to go is get our smart contract as a variable we can use. We'll also need to get our Celo account because we'll be sending transactions to the network.

After the imports, write the following:

```js
// Get Celo account info

let account = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY);
kit.connection.addAccount(account.privateKey);
```

The above code imports your private key we set in the second tutorial from the `.env` file and puts it into the account variable. It also adds the Celo account to contractKit.

Next, let's create an async function where we will write our interactions with the smart contract:

```javascript
async function interact() {
  // Check the Celo network ID
  const networkId = await web3.eth.net.getId();

  // Get the contract associated with the current network
  const deployedNetwork = CeloCrowdfund.networks[networkId];

  // Create a new contract instance from the celo crowdfund contract
  let celoCrowdfundContract = new kit.web3.eth.Contract(
    CeloCrowdfund.abi,
    deployedNetwork && deployedNetwork.address,
  );

  console.log('Account address: ', account.address);
  console.log(celoCrowdfundContract);
}

interact();
```

Let's run this. In the terminal, type: `node interact.js`. The result should be something like the following:

![code](./assets/celo-crowd-funding-project-code-13.png)

If all goes well, the output should show the account address, and the contract that we created. The contract output looks different than regular solidity code because it is a [contract ABI](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.3/abi-spec.html).

Great! So we've verified that the contract is getting imported correctly and our account works.

Next, comment out the `console.log` of the `celoCrowdfundContract` variable since we won't use it anymore.

The next step is to create a new `Project`. Create a new function outside of `interact()` called `createProject()`:

```javascript
async function createProject(celoCrowdfundContract, stableToken, gasPrice) {
  var projectGoal = BigNumber(1e18);
  await celoCrowdfundContract.methods
    .startProject(
      stableToken.address,
      'Test project',
      'We are testing the create project function',
      'https://i.imgur.com/Flfo4hJ.png',
      5,
      projectGoal,
    )
    .send({
      from: account.address,
      feeCurrency: stableToken.address,
      gasPrice: gasPrice,
    });
  console.log('Created new project');
}
```

This function takes in the `celoCrowdfunding`, `stableToken`, and `gasPrice` as parameters. It then creates a `projectGoal` using `BigNumber`.

We create a number that's of size 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 or 1^18 because cUSD has a size of 18 decimals. Solidity doesn't have support for floating point numbers, so the workaround is to make really large numbers. 1^18 cUSD is equal to $1 cUSD.

Next, we call the `startProject()` method in our crowdfunding contract and pass in the parameters it requires. If we go back to the `CeloCrowdfund.sol` contract, we'll see the `createProject()` method takes in the following:

```javascript
function startProject(
  IERC20 cUSDToken,
  string calldata title,
  string calldata description,
  string calldata imageLink,
  uint durationInDays,
  uint amountToRaise
)
```

These are the parameters we supply when we call the function.

Now that we have that, we will create a stableToken variable which uses the `ContractKit` stabletoken wrapper in order to get a reference to the cUSD coin.

We will also get the gas price to pass in to our functions. We'll set the gas higher than the recommended minimums in order to get our transactions confirmed faster. For a primer on gas fees in Celo, feel free to check out [this post](https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/what-is-a-gas-fee-on-ethereum/).

After getting those two variables, we will call the `createProject()` helper function inside `interact()`. We'll also return all the projects in our contract using the `returnProjects()` function in our `CeloCrowdfund` contract, to verify that it worked:

```javascript
// Print wallet address so we can check it on the block explorer
console.log('Account address: ', account.address);

// Get the cUSD ContractKit wrapper
var stableToken = await kit.contracts.getStableToken();

// Get the gas price minimum and set the new gas price to be double
const gasPriceMinimumContract = await kit.contracts.getGasPriceMinimum();
const gasPriceMinimum = await gasPriceMinimumContract.getGasPriceMinimum(
  stableToken.address,
);
const gasPrice = Math.ceil(gasPriceMinimum * 2); // This should be much higher than the current average, so the transaction will confirm faster

await createProject(celoCrowdfundContract, stableToken, gasPrice);

// Return projects inside the celo crowdfund contract
var result = await celoCrowdfundContract.methods.returnProjects().call();

console.log('List of addressses for each of the projects created:', result);
```

After running the code, you should see the new project created.

# Sending money to a project

Now that we've created a project, we'll need to send some money to it.

Just like how we created a variable called `celoCrowdfundContract` to access our `CeloCrowdfund` contract, we'll need to create a variable to access the `Project` contract.

To do this we can write the following:

```javascript
var projectInstanceContract = new web3.eth.Contract(
  Project.abi,
  deployedNetwork && result[result.length - 1], // Get the most recently deployed Project
);
```

This will create a variable to access the most recently created Project contract instance from the array returned by the `returnProjects()` function.

Now that we can access our project, we'll need to do two things in order to send cUSD to the contract. Since cUSD follows the [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) standard, we'll need to approve sending cUSD to the contract prior to sending money. After it's approved, we can send cUSD to our contract.

We'll approve a large amount of cUSD for the contract as an example. To approve 500 cUSD to be sent, write the following:

```javascript
// Approve the project to spend up to 500 cUSD from wallet
var approveAmount = BigNumber(500e18);
await stableToken
  .approve(projectInstanceContract._address, approveAmount)
  .sendAndWaitForReceipt({ from: account.address });
```

Great! Now we have approved our contract to receive 500 cUSD. The next step is to actually send some money.

Outside of the `interact()` function, create a new function called `contribute()`:

```javascript
async function contribute(stableToken, projectInstanceContract, gasPrice) {
  var sendAmount = BigNumber(2e18);

  // Call contribute() function with 2 cUSD
  await projectInstanceContract.methods.contribute(sendAmount).send({
    from: account.address,
    feeCurrency: stableToken.address,
    gasPrice: gasPrice,
  });

  console.log('Contributed to the project\n');
}
```

In the `contribute()` function, we create a variable called `sendAmount` which is set to 2E18. This is equivalent to 2 cUSD. Next, we use our `projectInstanceContract` variable to call the `contribute()`function in our `Project()` contract.

Back in our `interact()` function, let's call the `contribute()` helper function we created:

```javascript
await contribute(stableToken, projectInstanceContract, gasPrice);
```

# Displaying our balances

There are now two cUSD balances we care about: the balance of our Celo wallet, and the balance of our Project which the `contribute()` function sent 2 cUSD to.

Outside the `interact()` function, create a helper function called `createBalances()` to print this all out:

```javascript
async function printBalances(stableToken, projectInstanceContract) {
  var balanceOfUser = (await stableToken.balanceOf(account.address)).toString();

  console.log("User's address: ", account.address);
  console.log("User's cUSD balance: ", balanceOfUser / 1e18, ' cUSD\n');

  var balanceOfContract = (
    await stableToken.balanceOf(projectInstanceContract._address)
  ).toString();

  console.log('Contract address: ', projectInstanceContract._address);
  console.log('Contract cUSD balance: ', balanceOfContract / 1e18, ' cUSD\n');
}
```

The `printBalances()` function uses the `stableToken` variable's `balanceOf()` function in order to get our Celo wallet's cUSD balance. We then use that same `balanceOf()` function in order to get the balance of the contract, and then we print it all out.

Next, inside the `interact()` function just call the `printBalances()` function after `contribute()`:

```javascript
await printBalances(stableToken, projectInstanceContract);
```

# Paying out from our Project contract

So far we're able to create a Project, and fund it. The final step is paying out from our contract!

Outside the `interact()` function, create a helper function called `payOut()`:

```javascript
async function payOut(stableToken, projectInstanceContract, gasPrice) {
  var payOut = await projectInstanceContract.methods.payOut().send({
    from: account.address,
    feeCurrency: stableToken.address,
    gasPrice: gasPrice,
  });
  console.log('Paying out from project');
}
```

The `payOut()` function calls the `payOut()` function inside our `Project` smart contract. This will send all the funds sent back to the project creator.

Finally, let's call the `payOut()` helper function inside our `interact()` function:

```javascript
await contribute(stableToken, projectInstanceContract, gasPrice);
await printBalances(stableToken, projectInstanceContract);

await payOut(stableToken, projectInstanceContract, gasPrice);

console.log('After pay out: ');
await printBalances(stableToken, projectInstanceContract);
```

We'll want to wait 5 seconds before printing just to make sure the `payOut()` transaction has been confirmed on the blockchain.

Now let's run the code! In your terminal, type: `node interact.js`

The output should look something like this:

![output](./assets/celo-crowd-funding-project-output-14.png)

Awesome! As we can see from the terminal output, our script creates a new project, contributes 2 cUSD to it, waits 5 seconds, and then pays out from the project. We can see the flow of the 2 cUSD going from the Celo wallet --> the contract --> back to the wallet.

It works!

# Conclusion
