## Project setup 

This heading is an example only - You can use your own heading and subheadings for the body of your tutorial.

Following are examples for various types of content blocks and how to utilize the Markdown and MDX syntax.

## Code blocks

If you want to display terminal commands to users, use a code block with `text` syntax. 
Always leave a blank line before and after the code block:

```text
npm i -g yarn
npm i -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

For other types of code highlighting, use the name of the language that the code block contains:

Rust:

```rust
let _desc: String = read!(\"{}\n\");
println!();
```

TypeScript:

```typescript
function filterByTerm(input: string, searchTerm: string) {
    // TODO
}
```

Solidity:

```solidity
event TokenMinted(address indexed owner, uint256 indexed tokenId, string indexed tokenURI);
```
