## Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a subgraph from an already deployed smart contract on the Ethereum Rinkeby testnet, deploy it to the Subgraph Studio, and then use the Subgraph Studio Playground to query the subgraph.

## Prerequisites

To successfully complete this tutorial, you will need to have a basic understanding of Ethereum, the Metamask wallet and the NodeJS ecosystem.

## Requirements

- You will need Metamask installed in your browser. You can install it from <https://metamask.io/>
- You need to have a recent version of Node.js installed. We recommend using v14.17.6 LTS for compatibility.

Topics covered in this tutorial:

- Creating a subgraph in the Subgraph Studio
- Downloading the contract abi and then creating a subgraph from it
- Deploying the subgraph to Subgraph Studio
- Querying the subgraph using Subgraph Studio Playground
- Using metamask to interact with the Rinkeby smart contract

Topics not covered in this tutorial:

- Writing the smart contract and then deploying it to Rinkeby testnet

## Project setup

Run the below commands to install the npm dependencies globally. These are required to build and deploy your subgraph.

```text
npm i -g yarn
npm i -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

## Creating the graph project in Subgraph Studio

First, you will want to head over to the Subgraph Studio at <https://thegraph.com/studio/>.

![Login to Subgraph Studio](./assets/the-graph-query-ethereum-data-with-the-graph-login-to-subgraph-studio-2.png)

Click on the **Connect Wallet** button. Choose a Metamask wallet to login with. Once you are authenticated, you shall see the below screen, where you can create your first subgraph.

![Create your first subgraph](./assets/the-graph-query-ethereum-data-with-the-graph-create-your-first-subgraph-3.png)

Next, you need to give your subgraph a name. Give the name as **vending**. Once that's done, you will see this screen:

![Subgraph dashboard](./assets/the-graph-query-ethereum-data-with-the-graph-subgraph-dashboard-4.png)

On this screen, you can see details about the subgraph like your deploy key, the subgraph slug and status.

## Creating and deploying the subgraph

- Run the following command to create the subgraph by downloading the contract ABI from the Rinkeby testnet. A new directory called `vending` will be created, and all node dependencies will be installed automatically.

```text
graph init --contract-name VendingMachine --index-events --studio --from-contract 0x4006c82FfB71933160948626dB3Ff8D8aaad6510 --network rinkeby vending
```

This will fetch the ABI from the Rinkeby smart contract passed as an argument to `--from-contract`, and store it in the `./vending/abis` directory. The Graph CLI will auto-generate the mappings from the smart contract ABI. You can view the mapping in `./vending/src/mapping.ts`.

> By passing in `--index-events` the CLI will automatically populate some code for us in both `schema.graphql` as well as `src/mapping.ts` based on the events emitted from the contract.

Output:

```text
✔ Subgraph slug · vending
✔ Directory to create the subgraph in · vending
✔ Ethereum network · rinkeby
✔ Contract address · 0x4006c82FfB71933160948626dB3Ff8D8aaad6510
✔ Fetching ABI from Etherscan
✔ Contract Name · VendingMachine
———
  Generate subgraph from ABI
  Write subgraph to directory
✔ Create subgraph scaffold
✔ Initialize subgraph repository
✔ Install dependencies with yarn
✔ Generate ABI and schema types with yarn codegen

Subgraph vending created in vending

Next steps:

  1. Run `graph auth` to authenticate with your deploy key.

  2. Type `cd vending` to enter the subgraph.

  3. Run `yarn deploy` to deploy the subgraph.

Make sure to visit the documentation on https://thegraph.com/docs/ for further information.
```

- Run the following command to set the deploy key. Replace \<DEPLOY_KEY> with the key you got from <https://thegraph.com/studio/subgraph/vending/>

```text
graph auth --studio <DEPLOY_KEY>
Deploy key set for https://api.studio.thegraph.com/deploy/
```

- To create the subgraph, run the following command. Your new subgraph will be created in a `subgraph.yaml` file.

```text
cd vending
graph codegen && graph build
```

This will generate a `build` directory under `vending/build`.

Deployed to https://thegraph.com/studio/subgraph/vending

Subgraph endpoints:
Queries (HTTP):     https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/8676/vending/v1.0.1
Subscriptions (WS): https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/8676/vending/v1.0.1
```

Subgraph Studio might take few minutes to sync the graph from the Rinkeby testnet. Wait until the syncing process is complete.

Once the sync is complete, you can access the subgraph on the Playground to run your queries.

## Querying the graph

Head over to <https://thegraph.com/studio/subgraph/vending/> to start querying data with the Playground.

![Subgraph Studio Playground](./assets/the-graph-query-ethereum-data-with-the-graph-subgraph-studio-playground-5.png)

This is a basic GraphQL query for the subgraph we have created:

```graphql
{
  purchases {
    buyer
    amount
    remaining
    timestamp
  }
}
```

We can set the order direction using `orderBy` and `orderDirection`:

```graphql
{
  purchases(orderBy: timestamp, orderDirection: desc) {
    buyer
    amount
    remaining
    timestamp
  }
}
```

Or get the first `x` results using the `first` clause:

```graphql
{
  purchases(orderBy: timestamp, orderDirection: desc, first: 2) {
    buyer
    amount
    remaining
    timestamp
  }
}
```

Or skip forward results using the `skip` clause:

```graphql
{
  purchases(orderBy: timestamp, orderDirection: desc, skip: 2) {
    buyer
    amount
    remaining
    timestamp
  }
}
```

Or filter the results by certain conditions using the `where` clause:

```graphql
{
  purchases(orderBy: timestamp, orderDirection: desc, where: { amount_gt: 5 }) {
    buyer
    amount
    remaining
    timestamp
  }
}
```

## Creating data and querying it

Go to <https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x4006c82ffb71933160948626db3ff8d8aaad6510#writeContract> to see the Rinkeby smart contract.

![Rinkeby Smart Contract](./assets/the-graph-query-ethereum-data-with-the-graph-rinkeby-smart-contract-6.png)

Click on the **Connect to Web3** button. Choose **Metamask** from the wallet options. After authenticatng with Metamask, you shall see **Connected - Web3\[address]** instead of the earlier button. Make sure you are connected to the **Rinkeby** test network.

Click on the **purchase** row. You need to fill in **purchase** and **amount** fields.

![Rinkeby Smart Contract Purchase](./assets/the-graph-query-ethereum-data-with-the-graph-rinkeby-smart-contract-purchase-7.png)

Fill in **purchase** as **0.2** and **amount** as **20**. Click on the **Write** button.

It will open up the Metamask prompt. Make sure you are on the **Rinkeby** test network.

![Metamask](./assets/the-graph-query-ethereum-data-with-the-graph-metamask-8.png)

Once you click on the **Confirm** button, wait for your transaction to be mined.

Then come back to Playground, and run the below query (after replacing `<YOUR_ADDRESS>` with your Metamask wallet address):

```graphql
{
  purchases(
    orderBy: timestamp
    orderDirection: desc
    where: { buyer: "<YOUR_ADDRESS>" }
  ) {
    buyer
    amount
    remaining
    timestamp
  }
}
```

You will see the information about the purchase you just created!

```json
{
  "data": {
    "purchases": [
      {
        "amount": "20",
        "buyer": "<YOUR_ADDRESS>",
        "remaining": "84",
        "timestamp": "1631577213"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
