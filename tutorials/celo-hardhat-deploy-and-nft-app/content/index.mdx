# Introduction

In this tutorial we'll write a smart contract using the Solidity language and a contract from the Openzeppelin library for ERC1155 tokens. Using nodejs along with [Hardhat]() we will compile the smart contract code and also test the contract before deploying it. After deploying the contract we will create a custom task within Hardhat to create a Celo account and deploy the contract to the Celo network using [DataHub](https://datahub.figment.io). Lastly, we are going to use a React application that will connect to the Celo wallet account and interact with the deployed smart contract.

# Prerequisites

- We must have NodeJS >= v12.0 installed, preferably the latest version or an LTS release.
- Knowledge of JavaScript, Solidity and React is beneficial.

# Installing Hardhat

Hardhat is a development environment that compiles, deploys, tests, and helps you to debug your Ethereum smart contracts. Hardhat can also be used to deploy to the Celo network because Celo also runs the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). This means smart contracts which work on Ethereum will also work on Celo. For the purposes of this tutorial, we will assume that the reader understands how to initialize a new Node project with a package manager (`npm` or `yarn`). We will go over how to install and configure Hardhat now.

```text
npm install --save-dev Hardhat
npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/Hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai @nomiclabs/Hardhat-ethers ethers web3 @celo/contractkit
```

# Creating a new Hardhat project

From within the project directory, run :

```text
npx hardhat
```

Selecting 'Create a sample project' will allow Hardhat to start its installation process in the current directory. It will create subdirectories and put all of the necessary files in place to empower your project.

```text

# The OpenZeppelin ERC1155 library

ERC1155 is a novel token standard that aims to take the best from previous standards to create a fungibility-agnostic and gas-efficient token contract. ERC1155 draws ideas from all of ERC20, ERC721, and ERC777. ERC1155s are commonly used in NFT collectible projects, although they are not typically viewed as 'fine art' it is not unreasonable to use this token standard for such purposes. We will examine the use case of a token meant specifically for use within our Tiny Village.

# Install the OpenZeppelin contracts

This will install the OpenZeppelin contracts locally. The second command will create a new file called `TinyVillage.sol` in the `contracts` directory. The touch command is available on Linux and macOS. Windows users should use `type nul > contracts\TinyVillage.sol` instead, to create an empty file.

```text
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
touch contracts/TinyVillage.sol
```

# Write your smart contract

You'll need to add a license to your code with a comment at the top of the file: `// SPDX License Identifier: MIT`, the source code of the smart contract will be visible on the blockchain, it's a best practice to have a license on your code to avoid the problem if third parties use your code.

With `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;` you'll set a compiler version. The compiler version of your code and libraries must be compatible, the `import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol` will get the ERC1155.sol file in `node_modules` and other solidity files that ERC1155 will need to compile. Create your contract with `contract TinyVillage is ERC1155` to give the name of the contract and tell it to use the ERC1155 library using the `is` keyword from Solidity.

If you are using the Remix IDE, import the ERC1155 module from the OpenZeppelin repository on GitHub near the top of the file:

```text
import "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol";
```

So far, your Solidity contract would look like this:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol";
contract TinyVillage is ERC1155 {
  // TODO
}
```

# Write the NFT part of the smart contract

Inside the `contract TinyVillage is ERC1155` create the NFT's Identifiers with `uint256 public constant VILLAGE`. Create the list with our NFTs

```solidity
 uint256 public constant VILLAGE = 0;
 uint256 public constant MINE = 1;
 uint256 public constant FARM = 2;
 uint256 public constant MILL = 3;
 uint256 public constant CASTLE = 4;
```

The name is useful to remember the Ids it is possible to pass just the number without saving in a variable.

```solidity
 uint256 public constant VILLAGE = 0;
 _mint(msg.sender,VILLAGE,1,"0x000");
//The code are the same
 _mint(msg.sender,0,1,"0x000");
```

The constructor code is executed once when a contract is created and it's used to initialize contract state. The parament in `ERC1155` is a URI that can include the string {id} which clients must replace with the actual token ID.

```solidity
 constructor() ERC1155("https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmTN32qBKYqnyvatqfnU8ra6cYUGNxpYziSddCatEmopLR/metadata/api/item/{id}.json") {
  }
```

For token ID 1 and uri `https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmTN32qBKYqnyvatqfnU8ra6cYUGNxpYziSddCatEmopLR/metadata/api/item/{id}.json` clients would replace **_{id}_** with **_1_** to retrieve JSON at <https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmTN32qBKYqnyvatqfnU8ra6cYUGNxpYziSddCatEmopLR/metadata/api/item/1.json>. The JSON document for token ID 1 might look something like:

```json
{
  "name": "Mine",
  "description": "Mine inseda a tiny mount",
  "image": "https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmPoFKTD8U2Mg6kgMheyv9K4rtPRnKv78orRHjaYaTVqNm/images/mine.png"
}
```

# Write the function to mint the NFTs

Our function has 2 parts,the **_require_** that get balance and if the user of contract does not have yet the Nft the contract vai let mint a NFT with the **_\_mint_** function,What the mint does creates amount tokens of token type id, and assigns them to account.

```solidity
// If you do not have any village the contract will let you buy one
function mintVillage() public{
 require(balanceOf(msg.sender,VILLAGE) == 0,"you already have a Village ");
 _mint(msg.sender,VILLAGE,1,"0x000");
}

// If you do not have any Mine and have Village the contract will let you buy the Mine
function mintMine() public{
 require(balanceOf(msg.sender,VILLAGE) > 0,"you need have a Village");
 require(balanceOf(msg.sender,MINE) == 0,"you already have a Mine");
 _mint(msg.sender,MINE,1,"0x000");
}

// If you do not have any Farm and have Village the contract will let you buy the Farm
function mintFarm() public{
 require(balanceOf(msg.sender,VILLAGE) > 0,"you need have a Village");
 require(balanceOf(msg.sender,FARM) == 0,"you already have a Farm");
 _mint(msg.sender,FARM,1,"0x000");
}

// If you do not have any Mill and have Village and Farm the contract will let you buy the Mill
function mintMill() public{
 require(balanceOf(msg.sender,VILLAGE) > 0,"you need have a Village");
 require(balanceOf(msg.sender,FARM) > 0,"you need have a Farm");
 require(balanceOf(msg.sender,MILL) == 0,"you already have a Mill");
 _mint(msg.sender,MILL,1,"0x000");
}

// If you do not have any Castle and have all others NFt the contract will let you buy the Mill
function mintCastle() public{
 require(balanceOf(msg.sender,MINE) > 0,"you need have a Mine");
 require(balanceOf(msg.sender,MILL) > 0,"you need have a Mill");
 require(balanceOf(msg.sender,CASTLE) == 0,"you already have a Castle");
 _mint(msg.sender,CASTLE,1,"0x000");
}
```

See the complete [TinyVillage.sol](https://github.com/lucasespinosa28/Celo-Tutorial/blob/main/demo/contracts/TinyVillage.sol).

# Use HardHat to compile

In order to transform our Solidity code into a working smart contract, we must compile it. After compilation, we will get bytecode and other information about the contract in `artifacts\contracts\TinyVillage.sol\TinyVillage.json`. An artifact is part of the result of compilation.

To compile with HardHat, first delete `contracts/Greeter.sol` and the `test/sample-test.js`. Open the `Hardhat.config.js` file and set the same version that you are using in the **TinyVillage.sol** smart contract.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  solidity: '0.8.0',
};
```

To compile your smart contract just use the command:

    npx hardhat compile

If you have not deleted the `contracts/Greeter.sol` file it will give an error because that contract doesn't specify the same compiler version.

# Test and Deploy

Verify the code was compiled properly in `artifacts\contracts\TinyVillage.sol\TinyVillage.json`, this JSON file has all the information necessary to deploy a smart contract.

# Use Hardhat to test a smart contract

The best practice is test the smart contract on your machine before deploying. Create the test file in `test/tineyVillageTest.js`. The [Hardhat documentation](https://hardhat.org/guides/truffle-testing.html) has more information about testing using other libraries.

Import the `expect` module from [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) Chai is a testing library, it was installed in the first part of this tutorial).

```javascript
const { expect } = require('chai');
```

The most basic testing just deploys the contract and mints the Village. If the Village is minted the contract will pass.

```javascript
describe("TinyVillage Test", function() {
    it("Should mint village", async function() {

    const accounts = await ethers.getSigners();

    const TinyVillage = await ethers.getContractFactory("TinyVillage");
    const tinyVillage = await TinyVillage.deploy();

    await tinyVillage.mintVillage();
    const balance = await tinyVillage.balanceOf(accounts[0].address,0)
    expect(1).to.equal(Number(balance.toString()));
});
```

Testing the minting of a Castle would require us to mint every other type of NFT, but for the purposes of this tutorial we will cut it short and not cover testing all of the minting functions:

```javascript
    it("Should mint castle",async function () {
        const accounts = await ethers.getSigners();

        const TinyVillage = await ethers.getContractFactory("TinyVillage");
        const tinyVillage = await TinyVillage.deploy();

        await tinyVillage.mintVillage();
        await tinyVillage.mintMine();
        await tinyVillage.mintFarm();
        await tinyVillage.mintMill();
        await tinyVillage.mintCastle();
        const balance = await tinyVillage.balanceOf(accounts[0].address, 4)
        expect(1).to.equal(Number(balance.toString()));
    });
});
```

Now we will run the tests using Hardhat, depending on your machine the test time may be different. If all tests have passed, your smart contract is ready to deploy.

```text
npx Hardhat test

---
 TinyVillage Test
    √ Should mint village (5832ms)
    √ Should mint castle (2321ms)
  2 passing (8s)
```

See the complete code for [tineyVillageTest.js](https://github.com/lucasespinosa28/Celo-Tutorial/blob/main/demo/test/tineyVillageTest.js)

# Create a Celo account with Hardhat

To deploy your contract on Celo Testnet will need to create an account and save the privateKey to get an address for sent Celo test coin,In main folder create a file `celo_account.js`,We'll not use the default accounts, Because we'll need to save account to use later,

```javascript
const Web3 = require('web3');
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const web3 = new Web3();
const privateKeyFile = path.join(__dirname, './.secret');

// Function getAccount will return the address of your account
const getAccount = () => {
  const secret = fs.readFileSync(privateKeyFile);
  const account = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(secret.toString());
  return account;
};

// Function setAccount will crate new account and save the privateKey in .secret file
const setAccount = () => {
  const newAccount = web3.eth.accounts.create();
  fs.writeFileSync(privateKeyFile, newAccount.privateKey, err => {
    if (err) {
      console.log(err);
    }
  });
  console.log(`Address ${newAccount.address}`);
};
module.exports = {
  getAccount,
  setAccount,
};
```

In `hardhat.config.js` we will import the necessary modules to read the .secret file and the code of **_celo_account.js_**.

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const privateKeyFile = path.join(__dirname, './.secret');
const Account = require('./celo_account');
```

Below of others task add a new task, If the .secret file does not exist the task will create a new account if the .secret file exists the task will use the private key to get an address.

```javascript
task('celo-account', 'Prints account address or create a new', async () => {
  fs.existsSync(privateKeyFile)
    ? console.log(`Address ${Account.getAccount().address}`)
    : Account.setAccount();
});
```

When run `npx hardhat celo-account`, The new account is created and the privateKey will saved into .secret file. It is important save the address and go to the [Celo developer faucet](https://celo.org/developers/faucets) to get the coins needed to pay the fee to deploy.

# Deploy

If your code is already compiled and tested, It's time to deploy your smart contract. You will need to connect to the Celo blockchain. To do this you will need a server running the Celo network. To connect with Celo network and many other blockchain networks, one of the easiest ways is using Figment's DataHub service: Go to [datahub.figment.io](https://datahub.figment.io/) and chose Celo from the list of available protocols. ![Captura de Tela (43)](./assets/celo-hardhat-deploy-and-nft-app-captura-de-tela-43-2.png).

# Create the deploy task

Create `celo_deploy.js` and add the code below. `@celo/contractkit` is a library to help developers and validators to interact with the celo blockchain. `TinyVillage()` is the function used to deploy TinyVillage contract, the `/artifacts/contracts/TinyVillage.sol/TinyVillage.json` is the file that contains all the information about our compiled contract.

```javascript
const Web3 = require('web3');
const ContractKit = require('@celo/contractkit');

const web3 = new Web3(
  'https://celo-alfajores--rpc.datahub.figment.io/apikey/<your API key here>/',
);
const kit = ContractKit.newKitFromWeb3(web3);
const data = require('./artifacts/contracts/TinyVillage.sol/TinyVillage.json');
const Account = require('./celo_account');

async function TinyVillage() {
  const account = Account.getAccount();
  kit.connection.addAccount(account.privateKey);
  let tx = await kit.connection.sendTransaction({
    from: account.address,
    data: data.bytecode,
  });
  return tx.waitReceipt();
}
module.exports = {
  TinyVillage,
};
```

The same as you did in `task("celo-account")`, Create a task to deploy:

```javascript
const Deploy = require('./celo_deploy');

task('celo-deploy', 'Prints account address or create a new', async () => {
  const tx = await Deploy.TinyVillage();
  console.log(tx);
  console.log(`save the contract address ${tx.contractAddress}`);
});
```

Run the task `npx hardhat celo-deploy` to deploy. Then save the contract address to use in your React app, to interact with the smart contract. After you run the deploy task, if everything goes smoothly, the result should look like this (but with a different address and hash).

```text
npx hardhat celo-deploy

{
  blockHash: '0x7b653ecce5042d1424cd66a5ce36112c8ece51de50317851aa887ab7582d0cd3',

  status: true,
  to: null,
  transactionHash: '0x92bf51162e35ec0ebe984a67914f208720f5d73091978af346c413f2715c3601',
  transactionIndex: 0
}
```

Remember to save the contract address: In this example it is 0x47A424A0975924C3d177470C519C8DBA37e16Ec9, but yours will be different.

# Interact with the deployed contract

Marketplace sites like [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) do not display NFTs on Celo yet. To be able to view NFTs on Celo, we can build a React app. A sample project is available on [github](https://github.com/lucasespinosa28/Celo-Tutorial/tree/main/demo/start). The complete app is available on [github](https://github.com/lucasespinosa28/Celo-Tutorial/tree/main/demo/final)

# Show the images

Open the file `src/Images.js` and write the code in the place indicated by comment, the images are already saved in the app.

```javascript
// Access a the contract
const contract = new kit.web3.eth.Contract(
  data.abi,
  '0x47A424A0975924C3d177470C519C8DBA37e16Ec9',
);
// Array with address NFT's owner
const ownerAddress = [address, address, address, address, address];
// Array with NFT's id
const ownerIds = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4];
// Function that will return the NFT that you have
async function getBalance() {
  const balances = await contract.methods
    .balanceOfBatch(ownerAddress, ownerIds)
    .call();
  setBalanceArray(balances);
}
```

This code work accessing the smart contract using `kit.web3.eth.Contract...`,The code has 2 arrays one with user address and the other with list NFTs id , when call the function **_balance Of Batch_** in contract will return an array with each NFT that the user has,Depends on the balance the code will show a specific image for each array combination,example: if balanceOfBatch returns **_\[1,0,0,0,0]_** the code will show this image ![village](./assets/celo-hardhat-deploy-and-nft-app-village-3.png)

# Create a button to mint the NFT

Open the file `src/MintNFT.js`, this code works similarly to getting the balance like the **_Images.js_** component.

```javascript
// Access a the contract
const contract = new kit.web3.eth.Contract(data.abi, "0x47A424A0975924C3d177470C519C8DBA37e16Ec9")
// Array with address NFT's owner
const ownerAddress = [address, address, address, address, address]
// Array with NFT's id
const ownerIds = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
// Function that will return the NFT that you have
async function getBalance() {
    const data = await contract.methods.balanceOfBatch(ownerAddress, ownerIds).call();
    setBalanceArray(data);
}
// Run the code above
getBalance();
// This function will mint NFT depending on the name you give
async function Mint(name) {
    console.log(balanceArray);
    contract.methods.[name]().send({ from: address })
        .on('transactionHash', function (hash) {
            console.log(hash);
        })
        .on('receipt', function (receipt) {
            console.log(receipt);
        })
        .on('error', function (error, receipt) {
            console.log(error);
            console.log(receipt);
        });
}
```

To not create a function to mintVillage,mintFarm,mintMine and etc, The same function will mint an NFT using the name of the function it has in the smart contract , example:

```javascript
async function Mint("mintVillage") {
 contract.methods.["mintVillage"]().send(...
}
Mint("mintVillage")}
....
// If not using this method
contract.methods.mintVillage().send({ from: address })
contract.methods.mintCastle().send({ from: address })
....
```

If the code has any errors, remember to test the app.

```text
npm start
```
