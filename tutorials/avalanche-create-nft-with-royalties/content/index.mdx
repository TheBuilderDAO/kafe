# Introduction

An ERC721 token is a type of Non-Fungible Token (NFT) which can contain or reference metadata in the form of art or digital content such as pictures, audio, social media posts, websites and even generative art projects in a broader perspective - even Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality!

An NFT is represented by a discrete unit of data on a digital ledger known as a blockchain, where each token represents some unique digital properties, that cannot be interchanged. These tokens enable many use cases that would be impossible with interchangeable or "fungible" tokens, like specific utility, proof of ownership, and a unique asset transaction history.

Refer to the official Ethereum developer documentation to learn more about [ERC-721 tokens](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/).

# Prerequisites

In preparation for the tutorial, you will need to have a basic understanding of [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and Solidity [smart contracts](https://solidity-by-example.org/). Please refer to the Avalanche [smart contract tutorial](https://learn.figment.io/tutorials/deploy-a-smart-contract-on-avalanche-using-remix-and-metamask) for more information on the Avalanche wallet.

## Write a smart contract using Remix IDE

In the Remix IDE, create a new file and paste this ERC721 smart contract which imports the token standard from OpenZeppelin. The `import` lines will be processed by the Solidity compiler being run by the Remix IDE, and all of the dependencies (required files) will be brought into the Remix workspace.

```javascript
// contracts/GameItem.sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721URIStorage.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Counters.sol";

contract GameItem is ERC721URIStorage {
    using Counters for Counters.Counter;
    Counters.Counter private _tokenIds;

    constructor() ERC721("GameItem", "ITM") {}

    function awardItem(address player, string memory tokenURI)
        public
        returns (uint256)
    {
        _tokenIds.increment();

        uint256 newItemId = _tokenIds.current();
        _mint(player, newItemId);
        _setTokenURI(newItemId, tokenURI);

        return newItemId;
    }
}
```

This screenshot shows the main Remix IDE interface, with the Solidity code from above pasted into a new file called `ERC721.sol`

Go to the second tab in the sidebar to compile the Solidity code, which will also fetch and install the OpenZeppelin boilerplate for ERC721 smart contracts which was specified by the `import` statements.

![](./assets/avalanche-create-nft-with-royalties-image-2.png)

Open the file ERC721.sol in the `.deps/npm/openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/` directory to declare a royalties variable of the `uint8` type in the contract. This gives us the ability to specify the royalties as a number. The underscore before the variable name is to prevent [variable shadowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_shadowing).

```javascript
// .deps/npm/openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol
contract ERC721 is Context, ERC165, IERC721, IERC721Metadata {
    using Address for address;
    using Strings for uint256;

    // Token name
    string private _name;

    // Token symbol
    string private _symbol;

    // Royalties
    uint8 private _royalties;

    ...
```

![](./assets/avalanche-create-nft-with-royalties-image-3.png)

After declaring the royalties variable in the ERC721 contract, we must also initialize it in the constructor.

```javascript
    constructor(string memory name_, string memory symbol_, uint8 royalties_) {
        _name = name_;
        _symbol = symbol_;
        _royalties = royalties_;
    }
```

![](./assets/avalanche-create-nft-with-royalties-image-4.png)

To get the current value of the royalties variable from the smart contract, create a public function `royalties()`, which can be set as a `view` type. We also want to make it `virtual` so that it can be overridden by any contract which inherits the function. It will return a `uint8` value, which matches the value that `_royalties` stores on the blockchain.

```javascript
    function royalties() public view virtual returns (uint8) {
        return _royalties;
    }
```

We can now compile the amended ERC721 smart contract and check for warnings, making sure the declared solidity version and compiler version are similar. The Solidity compiler uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/), so be aware that for example the version strings `0.8.0` and `^0.8.0` are not equal.

Next, download and install the Metamask wallet for your browser. Create a new wallet in Metamask, then [follow our quick guide](https://learn.figment.io/tutorials/deploy-a-smart-contract-on-avalanche-using-remix-and-metamask#step-1-setting-up-metamask) to connect to the Avalanche Fuji C-Chain. You will need to have a valid DataHub API key for Avalanche.

Request AVAX from the test faucet for the deployment, from <https://faucet.avax-test.network/>.

Pass the required parameters to the constructor in Remix: the Token Name, Symbol and Royalties. Then click the Deploy button!

![](./assets/avalanche-create-nft-with-royalties-image-6.png)

Still on the Deploy & Run Transactions tab in Remix, call the respective functions; _name_, _royalties_ and _symbol_ from the deployed ERC721 smart contract.

![](./assets/avalanche-create-nft-with-royalties-image-7.png)

Copy the address of the deployed contract to import in the Avalanche wallet. It should now appear on the collectibles tab in the portfolio section inside your [Avalanche wallet](https://wallet.avax.network/).

Congratulations! You have successfully added the NFT as collectible in the Avalanche wallet.
