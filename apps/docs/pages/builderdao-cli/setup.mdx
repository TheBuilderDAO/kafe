# Instructions

1. Open the terminal on your local machine.
2. Go to the directory where you plan to keep a local version of the Kafe repo.
3. Clone the repository locally by running the following:

```text
git clone repo clone TheBuilderDAO/kafe
cd kafe
```

4. Build the CLI tool:

```text
yarn install
yarn build:cli
```

5. Confirm that you’re linked to the right `builderdao` CLI tool by running the following:

```text
cd packages/cli
yarn unlink
yarn link
```

6. You should now have access to the `builderdao` CLI tool. In order to test this, you can run `builderdao -h` → this will show some brief documentation, options and commands.
