# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will create, deploy, and interact with our first Vault Smart Contract on the Celo Ecosystem.

What's a Vault Smart Contract, and the deployment, and interaction thing?\
A Vault as defined in this tutorial proofs that your contributed funds are locked through inviolable smart contracts.

This tutorial has 3 parts as mentioned below -

- First, we'll create a new account and configure essential things to connect to Alfajores.
- Second, we will be deploying a Vault Smart Contract to the Alfajores Testnet using DataHub and Truffle.
- Third, we will interface with the deployed Vault Smart Contract and demonstrate its functionalities using a frontend with React and Web3.

# Prerequisites

- Go get a connection to Celo's Alfajores testnet through [DataHub](https://datahub.figment.io/services/celo) and come back when you have a Celo API key, this is required for the next steps in the tutorial.
- Please make sure that you completed the tutorials:
  - [Connect to Celo with DataHub](https://learn.figment.io/tutorials/connect-to-celo)
  - [Query account balances on Celo](https://learn.figment.io/tutorials/get-the-celo-balance)
  - [Transfer CELO tokens](https://learn.figment.io/tutorials/transfer-celo-token)
  - [Deploy your first Celo smart contract](https://learn.figment.io/tutorials/deploy-celo-contract)

# Creating Project (Central Base)

Since Celo runs the Ethereum Virtual Machine, we can use Truffle to compile our smart contract. But just to do things right, let's first initialize a node project (silently...).

```text
$ mkdir vault-dapp
$ cd vault dapp
$ npm init -y --silent
```

Adding our dependencies (for now):

```text
$ npm install --save @openzeppelin/contracts truffle @celo/contractkit dotenv web3
```

Initialize a bare-bones truffle project, by running the following command.

```text
$ npx truffle init
```

Set (datahub url + api-key, see Prerequisites for the api-key) to an environment variable. For this create a file called `./.env`

```text
DATAHUB_NODE_URL=https://celo-alfajores--rpc.datahub.figment.io/apikey/<YOUR API KEY>/
```

Make sure our `./.env` does not get pushed by mistake (our key is inside). For this create a new file called `./.gitignore`

```text
node_modules
.env
```

Lastly, initialize git.

```text
$ git init
```

OK, I'd love to congratulate you, we just initialized a node and a truffle project. We also added git and secured our key like a pro. Your directory tree should look like this:

```text
04/17/2021  05:03 AM    <DIR>          .
04/17/2021  05:03 AM    <DIR>          ..
04/17/2021  05:03 AM    <DIR>          contracts
04/17/2021  05:03 AM    <DIR>          migrations
04/17/2021  05:00 AM    <DIR>          node_modules
04/17/2021  05:00 AM           678,735 package-lock.json
04/17/2021  05:00 AM               395 package.json
04/17/2021  05:03 AM    <DIR>          test
10/26/1985  04:15 AM             4,598 truffle-config.
04/17/2021  05:00 AM               395 .env
               3 File(s)        683,728 bytes
               6 Dir(s)  231,304,970,240 bytes free
```

# Get Account and Funds

Our next step is to get an Account (Address / PrivateKey) from the Celo Alfajores Network. We are going to use Truffle Console to get one real quick.

Copy and paste the following into the `./truffle-config.js` that was generated by Truffle:

```javascript
// LOAD ENV VAR
require('dotenv').config();

// INIT PROVIDER USING CONTRACT KIT
const Kit = require('@celo/contractkit');
const kit = Kit.newKit(process.env.DATAHUB_NODE_URL);

// AWAIT WRAPPER FOR ASYNC FUNC
async function awaitWrapper() {
  let account = kit.connection.addAccount(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY); // ADDING ACCOUNT HERE
}

awaitWrapper();

// TRUFFLE CONFIG OBJECT
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    alfajores: {
      provider: kit.connection.web3.currentProvider, // CeloProvider
      network_id: 44787, // latest Alfajores network id
    },
  },
  // Configure your compilers
  compilers: {
    solc: {
      version: '0.8.3', // Fetch exact version from solc-bin (default: truffle's version)
    },
  },
  db: {
    enabled: false,
  },
};
```

Here we initialized a provider using our environment variable `DATAHUB_NODE_URL`.

# Connect to Alfajores with the console

Now we can connect to Alfajores using `truffle console` . Run the following on your console.

```text
$ npx truffle console --network alfajores
```

Once connected, initialize and print an account as follows:

```javascript
let account = web3.eth.accounts.create();
console.log(account);
```

This is my output:

```text
$ truffle console --network alfajores
web3-shh package will be deprecated in version 1.3.5 and will no longer be supported.
web3-bzz package will be deprecated in version 1.3.5 and will no longer be supported.
truffle(alfajores)> let account = web3.eth.accounts.create()
undefined
truffle(alfajores)> console.log(account)
{
  address: '0x7cdf6c19E5491EA23aB14132f8a76Ff1C74ccAFC',
  privateKey: '0x167ed276fb95a17de53c6b0fa4737fc2f590f3e6c5b9de0793d9bcdf63140650',
  signTransaction: [Function: signTransaction],
  sign: [Function: sign],
  encrypt: [Function: encrypt]
}
```

you can exit from console with `ctrl+C` or `ctrl+D`.

From here we need the address, and `privateKey` as I mentioned.

Success! We got and account, before we forget let's save it into our `.env` as we will use it later. Your `.env` should look like this.

```text
DATAHUB_NODE_URL=https://celo-alfajores--rpc.datahub.figment.io/apikey/<YOUR API KEY>/
ADDRESS=0x7cdf6c19E5491EA23aB14132f8a76Ff1C74ccAFC # your address
PRIVATE_KEY=0x167ed276fb95a17de53c6b0fa4737fc2f590f3e6c5b9de0793d9bcdf63140650 # your private key
```

# Funding the account

Let's add funds to our account using the Alfajores Faucet, go there with your address. (Do you also wish to have one but for the Mainnet): Go here -> [Alfajores Faucet](https://celo.org/developers/faucet) and you will get:

```text
cGLD => 5
cUSD => 10
cEUR => 10
```

you can verify your balance in [Alfajores Blockscout](https://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/) searching you `address`.

We are finally done with this section. We are getting closer by the minute.

# Deploy the Vault smart contract

Now that we have an account and funds, let's add a smart contract to our Truffle project. From the console, run the following:

```text
npx truffle create contract Vault
```

The above command will create a new Smart Contract in the following location:

```bash
ls -la vault-dapp/contracts # Listing directory: vault-dapp/contracts:

Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
-a---           4/17/2021  6:12 AM            114 Vault.sol
```

The code for the Vault Smart Contract its been cooked for us already. Copy, paste, read:

```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

contract Vault is Ownable {
    using SafeMath for uint256;
    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;

    struct Items {
        IERC20 token;
        address withdrawer;
        uint256 amount;
        uint256 unlockTimestamp;
        bool withdrawn;
        bool deposited;
    }

    uint256 public depositsCount;
    mapping (address => uint256[]) public depositsByTokenAddress;
    mapping (address => uint256[]) public depositsByWithdrawers;
    mapping (uint256 => Items) public lockedToken;

    address public helpiMarketingAddress;

    event Withdraw(address withdrawer, uint256 amount);

    constructor() {

    }

    function lockTokens(IERC20 _token, address _withdrawer, uint256 _amount, uint256 _unlockTimestamp) external returns (uint256 _id) {
        require(_amount > 500, 'Token amount too low!');
        require(_unlockTimestamp < 10000000000, 'Unlock timestamp is not in seconds!');
        require(_unlockTimestamp > block.timestamp, 'Unlock timestamp is not in the future!');
        require(_token.allowance(msg.sender, address(this)) >= _amount, 'Approve tokens first!');
        _token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

        walletTokenBalance[address(_token)][msg.sender] = walletTokenBalance[address(_token)][msg.sender].add(_amount);

        _id = ++depositsCount;
        lockedToken[_id].token = _token;
        lockedToken[_id].withdrawer = _withdrawer;
        lockedToken[_id].amount = _amount;
        lockedToken[_id].unlockTimestamp = _unlockTimestamp;
        lockedToken[_id].withdrawn = false;
        lockedToken[_id].deposited = true;

        depositsByTokenAddress[address(_token)].push(_id);
        depositsByWithdrawers[_withdrawer].push(_id);
        return _id;
    }

    function withdrawTokens(uint256 _id) external {
        require(block.timestamp >= lockedToken[_id].unlockTimestamp, 'Tokens are still locked!');
        require(msg.sender == lockedToken[_id].withdrawer, 'You are not the withdrawer!');
        require(lockedToken[_id].deposited, 'Tokens are not yet deposited!');
        require(!lockedToken[_id].withdrawn, 'Tokens are already withdrawn!');

        lockedToken[_id].withdrawn = true;

        walletTokenBalance[address(lockedToken[_id].token)][msg.sender] = walletTokenBalance[address(lockedToken[_id].token)][msg.sender].sub(lockedToken[_id].amount);

        emit Withdraw(msg.sender, lockedToken[_id].amount);
        lockedToken[_id].token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, lockedToken[_id].amount);
    }

    function getDepositsByTokenAddress(address _id) view external returns (uint256[] memory) {
        return depositsByTokenAddress[_id];
    }

    function getDepositsByWithdrawer(address _token, address _withdrawer) view external returns (uint256) {
        return walletTokenBalance[_token][_withdrawer];
    }

    function getVaultsByWithdrawer(address _withdrawer) view external returns (uint256[] memory) {
        return depositsByWithdrawers[_withdrawer];
    }

    function getVaultById(uint256 _id) view external returns (Items memory) {
        return lockedToken[_id];
    }

    function getTokenTotalLockedBalance(address _token) view external returns (uint256) {
       return IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this));
    }
}
```

Let's go through the main sections of the our Vault Smart Contract:

Structure to store our deposits:

```javascript
struct Items {
        IERC20 token;
        address withdrawer;
        uint256 amount;
        uint256 unlockTimestamp;
        bool withdrawn;
        bool deposited;
    }
```

`lockTokens` function accepts the following parameters when being invoked:

```javascript
lockTokens(IERC20, address, amount, time);
```

and it will lock an amount of ERC20 tokens in the contract for an arbitrary time.

```text
IERC20 _token, => An ERC20 Token.
address _withdrawer => The Address which can withdraw (usually same as deposing address).
uint256 _amount => Amount the ERC20 Token.
uint256 _unlockTimestamp => When to unlock deposit.
```

The `withdrawTokens` function accepts an address and checks it's existence as a `_withdrawer` in our Structure. The function also checks if funds are past the `_unlockTimestamp`.

```javascript
withdrawTokens(address);
```

```text
address _withdrawer => The address which was registered in our contract when the deposit was made _withdrawer
```

# Compiling the contract

We are now ready to compile our solidity code using Truffle. From your terminal run the following:

```text
npx truffle compile
```

This is my output, all good if yours matches:

```text
web3-shh package will be deprecated in version 1.3.5 and will no longer be supported.
web3-bzz package will be deprecated in version 1.3.5 and will no longer be supported.

Compiling your contracts...
===========================
> Compiling @openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol
> Compiling @openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol
> Compiling @openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol
> Compiling @openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol

> Artifacts written to vault-dapp/build/contracts
> Compiled successfully using:
   - solc: 0.8.3+commit.8d00100c.Emscripten.clang
```

Truffle automatically puts our Vault smart contract bytecode and ABI inside the following json file. Make sure you can see it!

```bash
$ ls -la  vault-dapp/build/contracts # Directory Listing: vault-dapp/build/contracts

Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
-a---           4/17/2021  7:12 AM         870362 Vault.json
```

I hope you are ready for deployment, because that's next!

# Deploying contract

One last step, is necessary to make a new migration to deploy the Vault Contract, create the file `migrations/2_vault_deployment.js` to achieve this

```javascript
const Vault = artifacts.require('Vault');

module.exports = function (deployer) {
  deployer.deploy(Vault);
};
```

With this we are ready to run `npx truffle migrate --network alfajores`, this will hopefully deploy our Vault Smart Contract to the Celo Alfajores Network. In your console run.

```text
npx truffle migrate --network alfajores
```

A successful deployment looks like this:

```text

Awesome!, our Vault Smart Contract is now in Alfajores, and we can deposit funds into it, lock them, and withdraw them. Let's build an interface in React for our Vault Smart Contract next.

## Take a break!

In this section, we’ve learned how to create our first Celo Vault contract, compile and deploy it to Alfajores, also some of the language constructors of Solidity. Congratulations for making it this far! Have a break, stand up and stretch, get some water and then come back for the React finale!

# Create the React dApp

Now that we have our vault contract, let's connect the methods with an interface.

## Interface with the Vault Smart Contract

First, let's initialize our react app, we can do this within our node/truffle project directory we have been working on:

One important thing, ensure that you have the latest version of `create-react-app` installed. If you have it installed already and encounter any errors, see [this article for help](https://reactgo.com/react-app-no-src-folder/).

```text
npx create-react-app my-vault-interface
cd my-vault-interface
```

We need to add the following dependencies to our new react project:

```text
npm install @celo/contractkit web3 dotenv
```

Let's also transfer our .env file over to this new project, with a quick fix:

```bash
REACT_APP_DATAHUB_NODE_URL=https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org
REACT_APP_ADDRESS=0x7cdf6c19E5491EA23aB14132f8a76Ff1C74ccAFC # your recently created account address
REACT_APP_PRIVATE_KEY=0x167ed276fb95a17de53c6b0fa4737fc2f590f3e6c5b9de0793d9bcdf63140650 # your recently created account private key
REACT_APP_VAULT_ADDRESS=0xB017aD96e31B43AFB670dAB020561dA8E2154C5B # the recently created address of the vault contract (see 2_vault_deployment.js deploy output above)
```

This is how mine looks like, as you can see we still have the same variables, juts added the `REACT_APP` prefix.

Next, let's transfer the json file where our contract bytecode and ABI resides (VAULT.json file), and paste inside a new `contract` folder into the root of our new React Project, see below:

```text
Original Location (Truffle Compile)
Directory: vault-dapp/build/contracts/Vault.json

Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
-a---           4/17/2021  7:35 AM         870803 Vault.json

React App Location
Directory: vault-dapp/my-vault-interface/src/contract/Vault.json

Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
-a---           4/17/2021  7:35 AM         870803 Vault.json
```

With this we complete the requirements of our frontend, to recap, this is how the React Project directory tree looks like:

```text
    Directory: vault-dapp/my-vault-interface

```

## Populate our main application

Our next step is to copy and paste some code to the App React Component `App.js`.

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { newKit } from '@celo/contractkit';

Let's go over our App Component, much fun here I promise...

`contractKit` will help us interact with the Celo Blockchain effectively and efficiently using web3 under the hood. Environment variables are present to use constant info, see the use of `dotenv`. Finally we import our json representing the contract (recently I learned this json with bytecode, ABI its called contract/truffle artifact)

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { newKit } from '@celo/contractkit';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
import Vault from './contract/Vault.json';

// LOAD ENV VAR
dotenv.config();
```

Next, we initialize our instance of `contractKit`, using our DataHub Node URL, we also add to the kit our test account using its private key. Finally the Contract Object is instantiated for later use.

```jsx
const kit = newKit(process.env.REACT_APP_DATAHUB_NODE_URL);
const connectAccount = kit.addAccount(process.env.REACT_APP_PRIVATE_KEY);

// CONTRACT INSTANCE
const VaultO = new kit.web3.eth.Contract(
  Vault.abi,
  process.env.REACT_APP_VAULT_ADDRESS,
);
```

We will be using `useState` to save, modify and display our balances (wallet and vault contracts), the deposits, the ID of the vault for withdrawing and the list of contracts,

```jsx
const [balances, setBalances] = useState({ CELO: 0, cUSD: 0, Vault: 0 });
const [info, setInfo] = useState('');
const [lockAmount, setLockAmount] = useState('0.3');
const [idVault, setIdVault] = useState('0');
const [listOfVaults, setListOfVaults] = useState([]);
```

Before we can interact with our new Vault Smart Contract, we need to approve the use of this smart contract by our wallet, setting a default `allowance`. The approve function creates and sends a `Transaction Object` indicating we are approving, though also setting a max allowance for this smart contract to use. After we `console.log` the receipt

```jsx
const approve = async () => {
  setInfo('');
  // MAX ALLOWANCE
  const allowance = kit.web3.utils.toWei('1000000', 'ether');
  // GAS ESTIMATOR
  const gasEstimate = kit.gasEstimate;
  // ASSET TO ALLOW
  const goldtoken = await kit._web3Contracts.getGoldToken();
  // TX OBJECT AND SEND
  try {
    const approveTxo = await goldtoken.methods.approve(
      process.env.REACT_APP_VAULT_ADDRESS,
      allowance,
    );
    const approveTx = await kit.sendTransactionObject(approveTxo, {
      from: process.env.REACT_APP_ADDRESS,
      gasPrice: gasEstimate,
    });
    const receipt = await approveTx.waitReceipt();
    // PRINT TX RESULT
    console.log(receipt);
    setInfo('Approved!!');
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
    setInfo(err.toString());
  }
};
```

Let's take a look at the `lock` function which follows. Here, we get our unlock timestamp (10 minutes after transaction is sent), we estimate gas, specify we will lock 1 celo, instantiate our contract object using it's abi and address. Our transaction object (txo) will use the `lockTokens` method available in our contract object, and pass our collected / required parameters (Token address, Account address and of course the amount to lock and the timestamp that represents how many time it will be locked). Finally the transaction object will be included in a new transaction (tx).

We await our receipt after, and `console.log` it.

```jsx
const lock = async () => {
  setInfo('');
  try {
    // TIMESTAMP
    const lastBlock = await kit.web3.eth.getBlockNumber();
    let { timestamp } = await kit.web3.eth.getBlock(lastBlock);
    var timestampObj = new Date(timestamp * 1000);
    // TIME TO LOCK + 10 MINS
    var unlockTime =
      timestampObj.setMinutes(timestampObj.getMinutes() + 10) / 1000; // 10 minutes by default
    // AMOUNT TO LOCK
    const amount = kit.web3.utils.toWei(lockAmount + '', 'ether');
    // ERC20 TO LOCK
    const goldtoken = await kit._web3Contracts.getGoldToken();
    // TX OBJECT AND SEND
    const txo = await VaultO.methods.lockTokens(
      goldtoken._address,
      process.env.REACT_APP_ADDRESS,
      amount,
      unlockTime,
    );
    const tx = await kit.sendTransactionObject(txo, {
      from: process.env.REACT_APP_ADDRESS,
    });
    // PRINT TX RESULT
    const receipt = await tx.waitReceipt();
    update();
    setInfo('Celo locked!');
    console.log(receipt);
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
    setInfo(err.toString());
  }
};
```

Our next stop is the `withdraw` function, it uses the `withdrawTokens` method in the contract, and needs the ID of the vault in where you want to withdraw, you can see those ids in the generated table

```jsx
const withdraw = async () => {
  setInfo('');
  try {
    const txo = await VaultO.methods.withdrawTokens(idVault);
    const tx = await kit.sendTransactionObject(txo, {
      from: process.env.REACT_APP_ADDRESS,
    });
    const receipt = await tx.waitReceipt();
    update();
    console.log(receipt);
    setInfo('Celo unlocked!');
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
    setInfo(err.toString());
  }
};
```

`getLockerIdsInfo` gets the list of vaults/lockers that the current account has in the contract. It uses the `getVaultsByWithdrawer`method of the contract returning an array of userfull info:

```jsx
const getLockerIdsInfo = async () => {
  setInfo('');
  try {
    const ids = await VaultO.methods
      .getVaultsByWithdrawer(process.env.REACT_APP_ADDRESS)
      .call();
    let vaults = [];
    for (let id of ids)
      vaults.push([id, ...(await VaultO.methods.getVaultById(id).call())]);
    console.log('IDS:', vaults);
    setListOfVaults(vaults);
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
    setInfo(err.toString());
  }
};
```

And last the markup that defines the buttons and labels, defines 3 buttons for approving the use of the contract, obtain the current balance in the account and get the IDs of the vault in the contract; Also two inputs for deposit and withdrawal some amount of Celos. Some labels show CELO, cUSD in the current account and TVL (Total Value Locked) in the contract. Last is the table with the vaults in the contract of the current user.

You can interact with the interface and see the contract behavior:

![](./assets/celo-vault-dapp.gif)

You can verify that the constraints of the contract are preserved, like the min time-locked, not existent IDs, already withdrawn lockers, etc.

It's important to see that always we use `try/catch` clauses to verify the reversed conditions and other errors that might occur.

# Conclusion

This tutorial was aimed to provide a bare-bones implementation of a dApp in the Celo Ecosystem. We covered the Vault Smart Contract development and deployment, together with the bootstrapping of a React Application to interact with its basic functions (approve, lock, withdraw). We hope to continue extending this documentation.

The tutorial was a team effort by [Celo Helpi](https://github.com/helpicelo).
