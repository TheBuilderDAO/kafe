# Introduction

Smart contracts that require blockchain-external realtime data or events require a trusted _oracle_, i.e. a trusted smart contract that provides the data on-chain.

What is it useful for?

- An oracle that provides XTZ/USD prices could allow users to deposit funds that are immediately converted to some on-chain asset and represented as fiat.
- An oracle that provides weather data could allow a tsunami insurance contract: users purchase coverage from the contract, which pays out when there's a sufficiently severe tsunami in their area
- A combination of different oracles could be used to provide consensus, for example, where only results published by a majority of the oracles are considered valid.

# Setup

- Follow instructions in [Client Setup](https://assets.tqtezos.com/docs/setup/1-tezos-client) to set up `tezos-client` and create a test network wallet
- Clone [`lorentz-contract-oracle` repo](https://github.com/tqtezos/lorentz-contract-oracle) from GitHub and build from source using `stack`.

# The CLI

```text
❯❯❯ lorentz-contract-oracle Oracle --help
Usage: lorentz-contract-oracle Oracle COMMAND
  Oracle contract CLI interface

Available options:
  -h,--help                Show this help text

Available commands:
  print                    Dump the Oracle contract in form of Michelson code
  print-timestamped        Dump the Timestamped Oracle contract in form of
                           Michelson code
  init                     Initial storage for the Oracle contract
  get-value                get value
  update-value             update value
  update-admin             update admin
```

# Originating the contract

## Printing the contract

The print command takes a single argument: `valueType`, the type of the value provided by the oracle.

Note: Until [Issue #6](https://github.com/tqtezos/lorentz-contract-oracle/issues/6) in the repo is fixed, the CLI tool will throw an error if `valueType` is _not_ `nat` when printing the contract or the `timestamped` version.

For example, if `nat`'s are provided:

```text
❯❯❯ lorentz-contract-oracle Oracle print --valueType "nat"

parameter (or (pair %getValue unit
                              (contract nat))
              (or (nat %updateValue)
                  (address %updateAdmin)));
storage (pair nat
              address);
code { CAST (pair (or (pair unit (contract nat)) (or nat address)) (pair nat address));
       DUP;
       CAR;
       DIP { CDR };
       IF_LEFT { DUP;

               { IF_LEFT { DIP { DUP;

                                 DIP { CDR } };
                           DIP { DROP;
                                 DUP;

                                       IF {  }
                                          { PUSH string "only admin may update";
                                            FAILWITH } } };
                           PAIR;
                           NIL operation;
                           PAIR }
                         { DIP { DUP;

                                 DIP { SENDER;
                                       COMPARE;
                                       EQ;
                                       IF {  }
                                          { PUSH string "only admin may update";
                                            FAILWITH } } };
                           SWAP;
                           PAIR;
                           NIL operation;
                           PAIR } } };
```

## Initial storage

```text
❯❯❯ lorentz-contract-oracle Oracle init --help
Usage: lorentz-contract-oracle Oracle init --initialValueType Michelson Type
                                           --initialValue Michelson Value
                                           --admin ADDRESS
  Initial storage for the Oracle contract

Available options:
  -h,--help                Show this help text
  --initialValueType Michelson Type
                           The Michelson Type of initialValue
  --initialValue Michelson Value
                           The Michelson Value: initialValue
  --admin ADDRESS          Address of the admin.
  -h,--help                Show this help text
```

Since we're using `nat`, `initialValueType` is `nat` and `initialValue` can be `0`:

```text
❯❯❯ lorentz-contract-oracle Oracle init \
  --initialValueType "nat" \
  --initialValue 3 \
  --admin $ALICE_ADDRESS
Pair 3 "tz1R3vJ5TV8Y5pVj8dicBR23Zv8JArusDkYr"
```

## Running the origination

> **NOTE:** to use the annotated (timestamped) version, e.g. for `nat`:

```text
❯❯❯ tezos-client --wait none originate contract NatOracle \
  transferring 0 from $ALICE_ADDRESS running \
  "$(lorentz-contract-oracle Oracle print-timestamped --valueType "nat")" \
  --init "$(lorentz-contract-oracle Oracle init \
  --initialValueType "pair timestamp nat" --initialValue 'Pair "2019-12-10T17:43:53Z" 26871' \
  --admin $ALICE_ADDRESS)" --burn-cap 0.859 --force
```

> **NOTE:** the `nat_oracle.tz` contract may be found [here](https://github.com/tqtezos/lorentz-contract-oracle/blob/master/nat_oracle.tz)

Otherwise:

```text
❯❯❯ tezos-client --wait none originate contract NatOracle \
  transferring 0 from $ALICE_ADDRESS running \
  "$(lorentz-contract-oracle Oracle print --valueType "nat")" \
  --init "$(lorentz-contract-oracle Oracle init \
  --initialValueType "nat" --initialValue 3 \
  --admin $ALICE_ADDRESS)" --burn-cap 0.612

# Setting up a server

While we have everything we need to originate and administer an oracle contract, we'd like to automatically push updates to the contract.

Below are two simple examples of how you can periodically fetch some data and automatically push it to the oracle contract.

## Minimal server implementation

A minimal server written in bash shellscript could consist of:

- A Bash script `update_value.sh` that gets the `NEW_VALUE` and then calls the `update-value` entrypoint:

```bash
##!/bin/bash
## update_value.sh

NEW_VALUE="$(my_get_new_value_script)

tezos-client --wait none transfer 0 from $ALICE_ADDRESS to $ORACLE_ADDRESS \
  --arg "$(lorentz-contract-oracle Oracle update-value \
  --newValueType "nat" --newValue $NEW_VALUE)" --burn-cap 0.000001
```

- A `crontab` job to run `update_value.sh` periodically (in the example it's daily at `5:03 pm`):

```text
03 05 * * * update_value.sh
```

## Docker Flask server

There is an implementation of the above Bash server in Python, packaged as a Docker image, which:

- Fetches the latest stock price from Alpha Vantage
- Runs a "cron job" to push the update to the oracle contract with [`pytezos`](https://github.com/baking-bad/pytezos) every 30 seconds
- Serves a webpage for debugging

It does the same thing as the Bash script where `my_get_new_value_script` fetches the latest ticker price from Alpha Vantage.

You can find the project on Github [here](https://github.com/tqtezos/lorentz-contract-oracle/tree/master/stock_ticker) or view the one-file Python code [here](https://github.com/tqtezos/lorentz-contract-oracle/blob/master/stock_ticker/tq/oracles/ticker.py).

To get the image from [the DockerHub repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/tqtezos/oracle-stock-ticker), run:

```text
❯❯❯ docker pull tqtezos/oracle-stock-ticker:2.1
```

The server is configured using environment variables:

- To generate the `TEZOS_USER_KEY` parameter, run: `echo "$(base64 MY_KEY_FILE.json | tr -d '\n')"`, where `MY_KEY_FILE.json` is your Tezos faucet file (see [here](https://faucet.tzalpha.net/) to get a testnet faucet file).
- You can get a free `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY` from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key)
- Alpha Vantage's `Search Endpoint` may be used to find `ALPHA_VANTAGE_TICKER_SYMBOL`'s

<!---->

    TEZOS_USER_KEY=".."
    ORACLE_ADDRESS="KT1CUTjTqf4UMf6c9A8ZA4e1ntWbLVTnvrKG"
    ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=".."
    ALPHA_VANTAGE_TICKER_SYMBOL="AAPL"
    FLASK_APP="tq/oracles/ticker.py"

To run the Docker container:

```javascript
❯❯❯ docker run -d -p 5000:5000 \
  --env TEZOS_USER_KEY=".."
  --env ORACLE_ADDRESS="KT1.." \
  --env ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=".." \
  --env ALPHA_VANTAGE_TICKER_SYMBOL="AAPL" \
  --env FLASK_APP="tq/oracles/ticker.py" \
  oracle-stock-ticker
```

Once it's up, it will serve the debug page and update the oracle contract roughly every 30 seconds.

You should be able to view the debug screen at `localhost:5000`, fetch the latest values using `get-value`, and use a block explorer to inspect the contract.

You can find a running example of the contract [on Carthage](https://you.better-call.dev/carthage/KT1CUTjTqf4UMf6c9A8ZA4e1ntWbLVTnvrKG/operations).
