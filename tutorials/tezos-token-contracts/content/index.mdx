## Using FA2-SmartPy

This tutorial shows how to interact with the “FA2-SmartPy” implementation of the FA2 standard on some common use-cases. The first part uses `tezos-client` commands to operate basic transfers and queries. The second part goes further: it uses the `fatoo` command line interface to do batched-transfers and use the “operator” mechanism to delegate transfer rights.

## Basic Usage With tezos-client

This assumes you have `tezos-client` properly set up to talk to Carthagenet or to a “full” [sandbox](https://assets.tqtezos.com/docs/setup/2-sandbox) (i.e. with bakers).

This part requires 4 accounts with a few ꜩ imported into `tezos-client`, as `administrator`, `originator`, `alice` and `bob`.

In the case of the sandbox tutorial we use `alice` also as `originator` and `administrator`:

    tezos-client import secret key alice \
    unencrypted:edsk3QoqBuvdamxouPhin7swCvkQNgq4jP5KZPbwWNnwdZpSpJiEbq \
    --force

    tezos-client import secret key originator \
    unencrypted:edsk3QoqBuvdamxouPhin7swCvkQNgq4jP5KZPbwWNnwdZpSpJiEbq \
    --force

    tezos-client import secret key administrator \
    unencrypted:edsk3QoqBuvdamxouPhin7swCvkQNgq4jP5KZPbwWNnwdZpSpJiEbq \
    --force

    tezos-client import secret key bob \
    unencrypted:edsk3RFfvaFaxbHx8BMtEW1rKQcPtDML3LXjNqMNLCzC3wLC1bWbAt \
    --force

## Get the Michelson code

FA2-SmartPy uses SmartPy's meta-programming facilities to provide more than one Michelson contract, a.k.a. _“builds.”_. A few of the builds are available at <https://gitlab.com/smondet/fa2-smartpy/-/tree/master/michelson>, see [below](https://assets.tqtezos.com/docs/token-contracts/fa2/1-fa2-smartpy/#originate) for a description of the various builds.

Let's download the “default” one:

```
wget -O fa2_default.tz \
'https://gitlab.com/smondet/fa2-smartpy/-/raw/4acac092/michelson/20200910-203659+0000_5060996_contract.tz'

```

# Origination

Origination works like for any contract, we need the above code, a few ꜩ, and a michelson expression to initialize the storage. In our case, it should look like:

    (Pair
       (Pair "<admin-pkh>" (Pair <nb-of-tokens> <ledger-big-map>))
       (Pair (Pair Unit <operators-big-set>)
             (Pair <paused> <tokens-big-map>)))

It is expected that `<nb-of-tokens>` is the cardinal of the `<tokens-big-map>` map, and that only “known” tokens are used in the `<ledger-big-map>` big-map. To maintain all invariants properly, it is recommended to initialize the storage empty, and use the `%mint` entrypoint to fill the contract.

Let's originate such an unpaused empty contract while setting the `administrator` address:

    tezos-client originate contract myfa2 \
    transferring 0 from originator \
    running fa2_default.tz \
    --init '(Pair (Pair "tz1VSUr8wwNhLAzempoch5d6hLRiTh8Cjcjb" (Pair 0 {})) (Pair (Pair Unit {}) (Pair False {})))' \
    --burn-cap 10 \
    --force --no-print-source

Outputs:

     Node is bootstrapped.
     Estimated gas: 135041 units (will add 100 for safety)
     Estimated storage: 4620 bytes added (will add 20 for safety)
     Operation successfully injected in the node.
     Operation hash is 'opa4ZVgJGkXzeRypcnqso1CF8LrgVEYq4R2QwGkFT2kzw2L9Tqp'
     Waiting for the operation to be included...
     Operation found in block: BM2FVXcXeYxBaDPkt1X2etZrnkJTG19pazm6wd5FVCrxGm6tS2o (pass: 3, offset: 0)

     ...

               tz1VSUr8wwNhLAzempoch5d6hLRiTh8Cjcjb ... -ꜩ0.257
     New contract KT1FQrHRqqqZ23Md9Ec5KJ3WK66fNxi9izZJ originated.
     The operation has only been included 0 blocks ago.
     We recommend to wait more.
     Use command
       tezos-client wait for opa4ZVgJGkXzeRypcnqso1CF8LrgVEYq4R2QwGkFT2kzw2L9Tqp to be included --confirmations 30 --branch BLKYS2BuTtAp6Qb6Uu5K4JPNvGhJecHmqrtiNNQWb29fsf4JbhS
     and/or an external block explorer.
     Contract memorized as myfa2.

# Mint

Here we want to make a transfer “as” the `administrator` set in the previous section.

The minting entry-point is not standardized in the FA2 specification, for fa2-smartpy it should look like this:

    (Pair (Pair "<address>" <amount>) (Pair "<token-symbol>" <token-id>))

The default build assumes that token-IDs are consecutive natural numbers (0, 1, 2, …), if because of some particular constraint the user requires arbitrary token-IDs there is a build option in FA2-SmartPy to generate such a contract (see [documentation](https://gitlab.com/smondet/fa2-smartpy/)).

For instance, let's, as `administrator`, mint 100 `TK0` tokens to `alice`:

     tezos-client transfer 0 from administrator to myfa2 \
    --entrypoint mint \
    --arg '(Pair (Pair "tz1VSUr8wwNhLAzempoch5d6hLRiTh8Cjcjb" 100) (Pair "TK0" 0))' \
    --burn-cap 3

Outputs:

     Node is bootstrapped.
     Estimated gas: 117731 units (will add 100 for safety)
     Estimated storage: 163 bytes added (will add 20 for safety)
     Operation successfully injected in the node.
     Operation hash is 'ooL9T4cK1RyYz4HxjfyixPW3n5iJf2hX6G47iQToa7sDTb6fjHr'

     Operation found in block: BMGWJeRyTtUL2Pi9xgAi3MU7kkgMCr4pUeYALaVhQAi4uJS37ae (pass: 3, offset: 0)

     ...

           Consumed gas: 117731
           Balance updates:
             tz1VSUr8wwNhLAzempoch5d6hLRiTh8Cjcjb ... -ꜩ0.163
     The operation has only been included 0 blocks ago.
     We recommend to wait more.
     Use command
       tezos-client wait for ooL9T4cK1RyYz4HxjfyixPW3n5iJf2hX6G47iQToa7sDTb6fjHr to be included --confirmations 30 --branch BM2FVXcXeYxBaDPkt1X2etZrnkJTG19pazm6wd5FVCrxGm6tS2o
     and/or an external block explorer.

# Transfer

The transfer entry-point in FA2 is “batched” at two levels i.e. one contract call contains a list of transfer elements, each transfer element is a “from-address” and a list of outgoing transactions:

    {
      Pair "<from-1>" {Pair "<to-1>" (Pair <token-id-1> <amount-1>)} ;
      Pair "<from-2>" {Pair "<to-2>" (Pair <token-id-2> <amount-2>) ; Pair "<to-3>" (Pair <token-id-3> <amount-3>)} ;
      ...
    }

Here we, as `alice`, transfer 5 of our 100 TK0 to `bob`:

    tezos-client transfer 0 from alice to myfa2 \
                    --entrypoint transfer \
                    --arg '{ Pair "tz1VSUr8wwNhLAzempoch5d6hLRiTh8Cjcjb" {Pair "tz1aSkwEot3L2kmUvcoxzjMomb9mvBNuzFK6" (Pair 0 5)} }' \
                    --burn-cap 3

Outputs:

     Node is bootstrapped.
     Estimated gas: 119800 units (will add 100 for safety)
     Estimated storage: 67 bytes added (will add 20 for safety)
     Operation successfully injected in the node.

     and/or an external block explorer.

## Get Balance Off-Chain

As an example of interaction with big-maps in the contract's storage using Michelson and `tezos-client`, here we obtain `alice`'s balance of TK0 tokens.

We need a script which takes the contract's storage type as parameter (literally copy-pasted), and uses Michelson to extract the value in the `%ledger` big-map; in this case we just display it with the `FAILWITH` instruction, but one could do much more, including putting in storage (left as exercise for the reader ☺). Let's save it as `get-balance.tz`:

    parameter
        (pair (pair (address %administrator)
                    (pair (nat %all_tokens) (big_map %ledger (pair address nat) nat)))
              (pair (pair (unit %version_20200910_tzip_93e5415e_contract)
                          (big_map %operators
                             (pair (address %owner) (pair (address %operator) (nat %token_id)))
                             unit))
                    (pair (bool %paused)
                          (big_map %tokens
                             nat
                             (pair (nat %token_id)
                                   (pair (string %symbol)
                                         (pair (string %name) (pair (nat %decimals) (map %extras string string))))))))) ;
    storage unit;
    code
     {
        CAR ; # Get parameter
        CAR ; # Get the pair (admin , _)
        CDR ; # Get the pair (all_token, ledger)
        CDR ; # Get %ledger
        PUSH (pair address nat) (Pair "tz1VSUr8wwNhLAzempoch5d6hLRiTh8Cjcjb" 0);
        GET ; # Get the value in the ledger at the above key
        FAILWITH
     };

In this case, we expect the `tezos-client` command to fail, since we want to read the error message:

    tezos-client run script get-balance.tz on storage Unit \
    and input \
    "$(tezos-client get contract storage for myfa2)"

Outputs:

     ...

       22:     GET ; # Get the value in the ledger at the above key
       23:     FAILWITH
       24:  };
     At line 23 characters 4 to 12,
     script reached FAILWITH instruction
     with (Some 95)
     Fatal error:
       error running script

We can clearly see in the error value (passed to `FAILWITH`) that `alice`'s balance is 95 TK0 (100 minted _minus_ 5 transferred to `bob`).

# The `fatoo` Application

## Obtain and Setup Client

In this section we use the `fatoo` command line interface to some _builds_ of FA2-SmartPy. You need `fatoo` installed in your `$PATH` or you may use Docker:

```bash
 fatoo --version
# or:
docker run -it --rm --entrypoint fatoo registry.gitlab.com/smondet/fa2-smartpy:4acac092-run --version
```

The `fatoo` application has many commands, see `fatoo [subcommand] --help`. At the same time, it is work-in-progress, so feel free to submit issues and feature requests in the main [repository](https://gitlab.com/smondet/fa2-smartpy/).

Two environment variables can be used to configure

- `fatoo_root_path`: logs, outputs
- `fatoo_client`: the more important one, it is an URI describing how to configure `tezos-client` and talk to the node:

See command `fatoo show-client-uri-documentation`:

> The URI follows the usual pattern: `<scheme>://<host>:<port>/<path>?<options>`:
>
> - `<scheme>` can be `http` or `http` (`--tls` option);
> - `<host>:<port>` defines the connection to the node;
> - `<path>` is the private-key (URI) for the “funder” account which is used to pay for gas and storage.
>
> Available `<options>` are:
>
> - `bake=true`: use the `funder` account to also bake blocks after injecting operations (useful for “manual” sandboxes);
> - `wait=<INT>`: set the `--wait` option of `tezos-client` (how many blocks to wait after an operation is injected);
> - `command=<STRING>`: use an alternative command for `tezos-client`.
>
> See for instance the current default: `http://:2020/unencrypted:edsk3S7mCwuuMVS21jsYTczxBU4tgTbQp98J3YmTGcstuUxsrZxKYd?bake=true`.

Assuming we are using the [sandbox](https://assets.tqtezos.com/docs/setup/2-sandbox) setup, we can configure the client using `alice`'s private key as follows:

```bash
export fatoo_client='http://:20000/unencrypted:edsk3QoqBuvdamxouPhin7swCvkQNgq4jP5KZPbwWNnwdZpSpJiEbq?wait=0'

# Or, for docker, use:

alias fatoo='docker run -it -u "$UID" --network host -v "$PWD:/work" -w /work --rm -e fatoo_client="http://:20000/unencrypted:edsk3QoqBuvdamxouPhin7swCvkQNgq4jP5KZPbwWNnwdZpSpJiEbq?wait=0" --entrypoint fatoo registry.gitlab.com/smondet/fa2-smartpy:4acac092-run'
```

The application has a `client` subcommand which just calls `tezos-client` properly, one may test their setup with:

    fatoo client bootstrapped

Outputs:

     Node is bootstrapped.

# Setup Accounts

Here we create four key-pairs from mnemonic seeds, to be used in the following sections:

    fatoo account-of-seed \
          "the-only-administrator-of-the-contract" \
          --output admin.csv
    fatoo account-of-seed \
          "the-0th-aka-first-owner" \
          --output owner0.csv
    fatoo account-of-seed \
          "ready-owner-one" \
          --output owner1.csv
    fatoo account-of-seed \
          "this-is-a-potential-token-owner-too" \
          --output owner2.csv

The resulting CSVs are in the same format as with [flextesa](https://tezos.gitlab.io/flextesa/), they contain: `<phrase>,<pk>,<pkh>,<sk>` see for instance:

    echo "Public key hash: $(cut -d, -f 3 admin.csv)"
    echo "Secret key: $(cut -d, -f 4 admin.csv)"

Outputs:

    Public key hash: tz1ZnxqPNMXyiZLTANYJLJ9ZTBpQ5Qu16BXe
    Secret key: unencrypted:edsk3ZAm4BwNkG2uUmCcA64BadPWuwNt16zZisnfcQEuvyStaBa6oG

Let's name all of these:

```bash
export admin_pkh="$(cut -d, -f 3 admin.csv)"
export admin_sk="$(cut -d, -f 4 admin.csv)"
export owner0_pkh="$(cut -d, -f 3 owner0.csv)"
export owner0_sk="$(cut -d, -f 4 owner0.csv)"
export owner1_pkh="$(cut -d, -f 3 owner1.csv)"
export owner1_sk="$(cut -d, -f 4 owner1.csv)"
export owner2_pkh="$(cut -d, -f 3 owner2.csv)"
export owner2_sk="$(cut -d, -f 4 owner2.csv)"
```

# Originate

The application contains the code for a few variants of the contract:

    fatoo list-contract-variants --details description --format markdown

Outputs:

    * `contract`: The default.
    * `dbg_contract`: The default in debug mode.
    * `baby_contract`: The default in Babylon mode.
    * `nolay_contract`: The default without right-combs.
    * `mutran_contract`: The default with mutez transfer entry-point.
    * `tokset_contract`: The default with non-consecutive token-IDs.
    * `perdesc_noops_contract`: The default without operators and with permissions-descriptor.
    * `perdesc_noops_dbg_contract`: The perdesc_noops_contract but in debug mode.
    * `single_contract`: The default for single-asset.
    * `single_mutran_contract`: The single-asset with mutez transfer entry-point.
    * `nft_mutran_contract`: The default in NFT mode with mutez transfer entry-point.
    * `lzep_contract`: The default with lazy-entry-points flag.
    * `lzepm_contract`: The default with lazy-entry-points-multiple flag.
    * `lzep_mutran_contract`: The default with mutez-transfer and lazy-entry-points flag.
    * `lzepm_mutran_contract`: The default with mutez-transfer and lazy-entry-points-multiple flag.

One can dump the Michelson code into a file (see `fatoo get-code --help`), but there is no need since one can directly originate contracts from the application. Let's originate `mutran_contract`, the full blown FA2 implementation with an extra entry-point which allows the administrator to transfer funds which may potentially end-up in the contract's balance.

```javascript
 fatoo originate mutran_contract \
         --administrator "${admin_pkh}" \
         --output-address kt1_mutran_contract.txt

‖ [FA2->Info]:
‖   Originations:
‖     * Success: mutran_contract (The default with mutez transfer entry-point)
‖       -> KT1Qmqtc6pYnivEkR1Pedt684XSH4RjmoU6w
```

The command has saved the contract address in the file:

```javascript
 cat kt1_mutran_contract.txt
┃ KT1Qmqtc6pYnivEkR1Pedt684XSH4RjmoU6w
```

And we can already display the state of the contract (storage):

```javascript
 fatoo show-storage "$(cat kt1_mutran_contract.txt)"
‖ [FA2->Info]:
‖   Contract: KT1Qmqtc6pYnivEkR1Pedt684XSH4RjmoU6w
‖     Balance: 0 mutez
‖     Administrator: "tz1ZnxqPNMXyiZLTANYJLJ9ZTBpQ5Qu16BXe"
‖     Status: Ready
‖     Tokens-big-map: 26
‖     Ledger-big-map: 24
‖     Operators-big-map: 25
‖     All-Tokens: None
‖     Known-Owners-and-Operators: None
```

#### Mint and Multi-Transfer

In order to mint tokens, the administrator needs to be able to call the contract on chain, for this we need to transfer at least a few μꜩ to that address. One can use `tezos-client` but `fatoo` has shortcut command to transfer from the configured “funding” account (amounts are in `mutez`):

```javascript
 fatoo fund-address \
         "${admin_pkh}" \
         10_000_000
‖ [FA2->Info]: Balance for tz1ZnxqPNMXyiZLTANYJLJ9ZTBpQ5Qu16BXe is now
‖   4058182245 mutez.
```

Note that for now `owner0` does not exist on chain, we're still minting tokens to them:

```javascript
 fatoo call-mint --token-id 0 --token-symbol TQ0 \
         "${owner0_pkh}" 1_000_000 \
         --source "${admin_sk}" \
         --address "$(cat kt1_mutran_contract.txt)"
┃ (Pair (Pair "tz1MUP3sCWTUQRG2Hon7uhRfmuYZ4guEQntS" 1000000) (Pair "TQ0" 0))
```

Let's add another token `TQ1` still minting some to `owner0`:

```javascript
 fatoo call-mint --token-id 1 --token-symbol TQ1 \
         "${owner0_pkh}" 2_000 \
         --source "${admin_sk}" \
         --address "$(cat kt1_mutran_contract.txt)"
┃ (Pair (Pair "tz1MUP3sCWTUQRG2Hon7uhRfmuYZ4guEQntS" 2000) (Pair "TQ1" 1))
```

Let's see the storage; we see the new tokens `TQ0` and `TQ1` and, since we provide a “known token owner” on the command-line, we can see their balances:

```javascript
 fatoo show-storage "$(cat kt1_mutran_contract.txt)" \
         --known-address "$(cut -d, -f 3 owner0.csv)"
‖ [FA2->Info]:
‖   Contract: KT1Qmqtc6pYnivEkR1Pedt684XSH4RjmoU6w
‖     Balance: 0 mutez
‖     Administrator: "tz1ZnxqPNMXyiZLTANYJLJ9ZTBpQ5Qu16BXe"
‖     Status: Ready
‖     Tokens-big-map: 26
‖     Ledger-big-map: 24
‖     Operators-big-map: 25
‖     All-Tokens: 0 = TQ0.
‖                 1 = TQ1.
‖     Known-Owners-and-Operators:
‖       * Owner: "tz1MUP3sCWTUQRG2Hon7uhRfmuYZ4guEQntS" [0 ops]
‖         - Balance: 1000000 TQ0(0)
‖         - Balance: 2000 TQ1(1)
```

Now let's get `owner0` to do a batch-transfer. First, we need to feed some gas to that address:

```javascript
 fatoo fund-address \
         "${owner0_pkh}" \
         1_000_000
‖ [FA2->Info]: Balance for tz1MUP3sCWTUQRG2Hon7uhRfmuYZ4guEQntS is now 4335411
‖   mutez.
```

Then, since the token-owner can do self-transfer we use `owner1`'s secret-key to transfer TQ0s and TQ1s to `owner1` and `owner2`:

```javascript
 fatoo call-transfer \
         "from:${owner0_pkh} to:${owner1_pkh} amount: 10 token: 0" \
         "from:${owner0_pkh} to:${owner1_pkh} amount: 100 token: 1" \
         "from:${owner0_pkh} to:${owner2_pkh} amount: 10 token: 1" \
         --source "${owner0_sk}" \
         --address "$(cat kt1_mutran_contract.txt)"
┃ { Pair "tz1MUP3sCWTUQRG2Hon7uhRfmuYZ4guEQntS" { Pair "tz1YYrxf529d3EYzEv5TnsiTpRCzFFB87dAS" (Pair 0 10) ; Pair "tz1YYrxf529d3EYzEv5TnsiTpRCzFFB87dAS" (Pair 1 100) ; Pair "tz1TyFYCuKrQ7A3yB4AvpoPRLacb3J6iQB9V" (Pair 1 10)}}
```

We can then observe the resulting state:

```javascript
 fatoo show-storage "$(cat kt1_mutran_contract.txt)" \
         --known-address "$(cut -d, -f 3 owner0.csv)" \
         --known-address "$(cut -d, -f 3 owner1.csv)" \
         --known-address "$(cut -d, -f 3 owner2.csv)"
‖ [FA2->Info]:
‖   Contract: KT1Qmqtc6pYnivEkR1Pedt684XSH4RjmoU6w
‖     Balance: 0 mutez
‖     Administrator: "tz1ZnxqPNMXyiZLTANYJLJ9ZTBpQ5Qu16BXe"
‖     Status: Ready

```

## Using Operators

Let's create an `operator` key-pair:

```javascript
 fatoo account-of-seed \
         "youve-been-operated-ill-be-back" \
         --output operator.csv
   export operator_pkh="$(cut -d, -f 3 operator.csv)"
   export operator_sk="$(cut -d, -f 4 operator.csv)"
```

We will now get all the owners to delegate _all_ their tokens to “operator,” see also the command `fatoo call-update-operators --help`:

```javascript
 fatoo call-update-operators \
         "add@ operator: ${operator_pkh} owner: ${owner0_pkh} token: 0" \
         "add@ operator: ${operator_pkh} owner: ${owner0_pkh} token: 1" \
         --source "${owner0_sk}" \
         --address "$(cat kt1_mutran_contract.txt)"
   fatoo fund-address \
         "${owner1_pkh}" \
         1_000_000
   fatoo call-update-operators \
         "add@ operator: ${operator_pkh} owner: ${owner1_pkh} token: 0" \
         "add@ operator: ${operator_pkh} owner: ${owner1_pkh} token: 1" \
         --source "${owner1_sk}" \
         --address "$(cat kt1_mutran_contract.txt)"
   fatoo fund-address \
         "${owner2_pkh}" \
         1_000_000
   fatoo call-update-operators \
         "add@ operator: ${operator_pkh} owner: ${owner2_pkh} token: 0" \
         "add@ operator: ${operator_pkh} owner: ${owner2_pkh} token: 1" \
         --source "${owner2_sk}" \
         --address "$(cat kt1_mutran_contract.txt)"
```

We see that now, the same operator is present in every account:

```javascript
 fatoo show-storage "$(cat kt1_mutran_contract.txt)" \
         --known-address "$(cut -d, -f 3 owner0.csv)" \
         --known-address "$(cut -d, -f 3 owner1.csv)" \
         --known-address "$(cut -d, -f 3 owner2.csv)" \
         --known-address "$(cut -d, -f 3 operator.csv)"
‖ [FA2->Info]:

‖         - Balance: 999990 TQ0(0)
‖         - Balance: 1890 TQ1(1)
‖       * Owner: "tz1YYrxf529d3EYzEv5TnsiTpRCzFFB87dAS"
‖         - Operator: "tz1NkpWhHsBSZHPg2Ljz2hycRiZvcYdcyu85" -> [0, 1]

‖       * Owner: "tz1NkpWhHsBSZHPg2Ljz2hycRiZvcYdcyu85" [0 ops] [0 toks]
```

Finally, let's get `operator` to run a _batch-transfer-heist_ of all the tokens:

```javascript
 fatoo fund-address \
         "${operator_pkh}" \
         2_000_000_000

‖ [FA2->Info]: Balance for tz1NkpWhHsBSZHPg2Ljz2hycRiZvcYdcyu85 is now
‖   5999358655 mutez.
```

```javascript
 fatoo call-transfer \
         "from:${owner0_pkh} to:${operator_pkh} amount: 999990 token: 0" \
         "from:${owner0_pkh} to:${operator_pkh} amount: 1890 token: 1" \
         "from:${owner1_pkh} to:${operator_pkh} amount: 10 token: 0" \
         "from:${owner1_pkh} to:${operator_pkh} amount: 100 token: 1" \
         "from:${owner2_pkh} to:${operator_pkh} amount: 10 token: 1" \
         --source "${operator_sk}" \
         --address "$(cat kt1_mutran_contract.txt)"
┃ { Pair "tz1MUP3sCWTUQRG2Hon7uhRfmuYZ4guEQntS" { Pair "tz1NkpWhHsBSZHPg2Ljz2hycRiZvcYdcyu85" (Pair 0 999990) ; Pair "tz1NkpWhHsBSZHPg2Ljz2hycRiZvcYdcyu85" (Pair 1 1890)} ; Pair "tz1YYrxf529d3EYzEv5TnsiTpRCzFFB87dAS" { Pair "tz1NkpWhHsBSZHPg2Ljz2hycRiZvcYdcyu85" (Pair 0 10) ; Pair "tz1NkpWhHsBSZHPg2Ljz2hycRiZvcYdcyu85" (Pair 1 100)} ; Pair "tz1TyFYCuKrQ7A3yB4AvpoPRLacb3J6iQB9V" { Pair "tz1NkpWhHsBSZHPg2Ljz2hycRiZvcYdcyu85" (Pair 1 10)}}

```

We can then observe the resulting state where all the balances are `0` except for `operator` who owns the total supply:

```javascript
 fatoo show-storage "$(cat kt1_mutran_contract.txt)" \
         --known-address "$(cut -d, -f 3 owner0.csv)" \
         --known-address "$(cut -d, -f 3 owner1.csv)" \
         --known-address "$(cut -d, -f 3 owner2.csv)" \

## Retrieve The Contract's Balance

The build of the contract we originated above has an extra entry-point to be able to transfer the balance of the contract, e.g. in case somebody accidentally transfers μꜩ to the contract.

So let's imagine than after the above heist, `operator` wants to publicly tip/bribe the contract's administrator(s) by going through the contract itself (this may be a convoluted excuse to put XTZ on the contract …). We call the `transfer` entry-point with an empty list of transfer-items but with a few XTZ as amount:

```javascript
tezos-client import secret key operator \
"${operator_sk}" --force

tezos-client transfer 1_000 from operator \
to "$(cat kt1_mutran_contract.txt)" \
--entrypoint transfer \
--arg '{}' --burn-cap 1
┃
┃ ...
┃
┃       Balance updates:
┃         tz1NkpWhHsBSZHPg2Ljz2hycRiZvcYdcyu85 ... -ꜩ1000
┃         KT1Qmqtc6pYnivEkR1Pedt684XSH4RjmoU6w ... +ꜩ1000
┃ The operation has only been included 0 blocks ago.
┃ We recommend to wait more.
┃ Use command
┃   tezos-client wait for op3KWkf8zB431zBCkK5KYxHKRResGrri95vcQmxFyiJnUtg2S8Z to be included --confirmations 30 --branch BMTLWbbEZGgzNyqtvfdFA4mrhAXAheGUUtmCrTVvBYpP9oZinP5
┃ and/or an external block explorer.
```

We see that `fatoo` shows a non-zero balance for the contract now:

     fatoo show-storage "$(cat kt1_mutran_contract.txt)"

Outputs:

    ‖ [FA2->Info]:
    ‖   Contract: KT1Qmqtc6pYnivEkR1Pedt684XSH4RjmoU6w
    ‖     Balance: 1000000000 mutez

    ‖                 1 = TQ1.
    ‖     Known-Owners-and-Operators: None

Let's make `admin` retrieve that money for themselves; the entry-point is called `mutez_transfer` and takes a pair `mutez × address`:

```javascript
tezos-client import secret key admin \
"${admin_sk}" --force

tezos-client transfer 0 from admin \
to "$(cat kt1_mutran_contract.txt)" \
--entrypoint mutez_transfer \
--arg "Pair 1000000000 \"${admin_pkh}\"" \
--burn-cap 1
```

Outputs:

    ┃
    ┃ ...
    ┃
    ┃         Balance updates:
    ┃           KT1Qmqtc6pYnivEkR1Pedt684XSH4RjmoU6w ... -ꜩ1000
    ┃           tz1ZnxqPNMXyiZLTANYJLJ9ZTBpQ5Qu16BXe ... +ꜩ1000
    ┃ The operation has only been included 0 blocks ago.
    ┃ We recommend to wait more.
    ┃ Use command
    ┃   tezos-client wait for oooyQH1YZnngpPaf8KDuVStqQEnq7Y2XD1LRoQTnnWjJ4zZkaeg to be included --confirmations 30 --branch BLu5hPEMU3KBawfcRcDgsbMAoBrXGKT2r555seMpaiN7yhiePPX
    ┃ and/or an external block explorer.

We see that the balance is gone from the KT1:

```javascript
 fatoo show-storage "$(cat kt1_mutran_contract.txt)"
```

Outputs:

    ‖ [FA2->Info]:
    ‖   Contract: KT1Qmqtc6pYnivEkR1Pedt684XSH4RjmoU6w
