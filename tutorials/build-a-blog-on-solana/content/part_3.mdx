## Part 3: Conclusion

Template, Additional topics and more information

### Using this template

You will likely copy this template using the `builderdao tutorial init` command, so it will be available for you to edit
inside of your own directory (based on the slug from your proposal on KafÃ©), such as `tutorials/my-awesome-guide/content/index.mdx`.

If you would like to easily trim out all of the explanations and begin filling in the template with your guide,
we recommend you perform a regular expression search and replace for the string `^> > >.*$` within the `tutorials/<YOUR_SLUG>/content` directory,
which will select the lines for removal. Removing them all will leave you with an empty guide template, ready for writing.

## Additional topics
